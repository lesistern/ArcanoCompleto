BARBARIAN

From the frozen wastes of the north and the hellish jungles of the south come brave, even reckless, warriors. Civilized people call them barbarians or berserkers and suspect them of mayhem, impiety, and atrocities. These "barbarians," however, have proven their mettle and their value to those who would be their allies. To enemies who underestimated them, they have proved their cunning, resourcefulness, persistence, and mercilessness.

Adventuring is the best chance barbarians have of finding a place in a civilized society. They''re not well suited to the monotony of guard duty or other mundane tasks. Barbarians also have no trouble with the dangers, the uncertainties, and the wandering that adventuring involves. They may adventure to defeat hated enemies. They have a noted distaste for that which they consider unnatural, including undead, demons, and devils.

The barbarian is an excellent warrior. Where the fighter''s skill in combat comes from training and discipline, however, the barbarian has a powerful rage. While in this berserk fury, he becomes stronger and tougher, better able to defeat his foes and withstand their attacks. These rages leave him winded, and he has the energy for only a few such spectacular displays per day, but those few rages are usually sufficient. He is at home in the wild, and he runs at great speed.

Barbarians are never lawful. They may be honorable, but at heart they are wild. This wildness is their strength, and it could not live in a lawful soul. At best, barbarians of chaotic alignment are free and expressive. At worst, they are thoughtlessly destructive.

Some barbarians distrust established religions and prefer an intuitive, natural relationship to the cosmos over formal worship. Others devote themselves to powerful deities, such as Kord (god of strength), Obad-Hai (god of nature), or Erythnul (god of slaughter). A barbarian is capable of fierce devotion to his god.

Barbarians come from uncivilized lands or from barbaric tribes on the outskirts of civilization. A barbarian adventurer may have been lured to the settled lands by the promise of riches, may have escaped after being captured in his homeland and sold into "civilized" slavery, may have been recruited as a soldier, or may have been driven out of his homeland by invaders. Barbarians share no bond with each other unless they come from the same tribe or land. In fact, they think of themselves not as barbarians but as warriors.

Human barbarians come from the distant wild lands on the edge of civilization. Most half-orc barbarians lived among orcs before abandoning them for human lands. Dwarf barbarians are rare, usually hailing from dwarven kingdoms that have fallen into barbarism as a result of recurrent war with goblinoids, orcs, and giants. Barbarians of other races are very rare.

Among the brutal humanoids, barbarians are more common than fighters. Orcs and ogres are especially likely to be barbarians.

As people of the wild, barbarians are most comfortable in the company of rangers, druids, and clerics of nature deities, such as Obad-Hai or Ehlonna. Many barbarians admire the talents and spontaneity of bards, and some are enthusiastic lovers of music. Barbarians don''t trust that which they don''t understand, and that includes wizardry, which they call "book magic." They find sorcerers more understandable than wizards, but maybe that''s just because sorcerers tend to be more charismatic. Monks, with their studied, practiced, deliberate approach to combat, sometimes have a hard time seeing eye to eye with barbarians, but members of these classes aren''t necessarily hostile to each other. Barbarians have no special attitudes toward fighters, paladins, clerics, or rogues.

A barbarian''s typical primary role in a group of adventurers is as a front-line combat specialist. No other character can match his sheer toughness. He can also serve as a good scout, thanks to his speed, skill selection, and trap sense.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Hit Die: d12.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the barbarian.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A barbarian is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, light armor, medium armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Fast Movement (Ex): A barbarian''s land speed is faster than the norm for his race by +10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load. Apply this bonus before modifying the barbarian''s speed because of any load carried or armor worn.

Illiteracy: Barbarians are the only characters who do not automatically know how to read and write. A barbarian may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak. A barbarian who gains a level in any other class automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains a barbarian level does not lose the literacy he or she already had.

Rage (Ex): A barbarian can fly into a rage a certain number of times per day. In a rage, a barbarian temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and a +2 morale bonus on Will saves, but he takes a –2 penalty to Armor Class. The increase in Constitution increases the barbarian''s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the rage when his Constitution score drops back to normal. (These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are.) While raging, a barbarian cannot use any Charisma-, Dexterity-, or Intelligence-based skills (except for Balance, Escape Artist, Intimidate, and Ride), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except Combat Expertise, item creation feats, and metamagic feats. A fit of rage lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character''s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A barbarian may prematurely end his rage. At the end of the rage, the barbarian loses the rage modifiers and restrictions and becomes fatigued (–2 penalty to Strength, –2 penalty to Dexterity, can''t charge or run) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies; see below).
A barbarian can fly into a rage only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use his rage ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level). Entering a rage takes no time itself, but a barbarian can do it only during his action, not in response to someone else''s action.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 2nd level, a barbarian retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if he is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, he still loses his Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized. If a barbarian already has uncanny dodge from a different class, he automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

Trap Sense (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking him, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels. If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum level a rogue must be to flank the character.

Damage Reduction (Ex): At 7th level, a barbarian gains Damage Reduction. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction rises by 1 point. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

Greater Rage (Ex): At 11th level, a barbarian''s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +6, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +3. The penalty to AC remains at –2.

Indomitable Will (Ex): While in a rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on Will saves he also receives during his rage.

Tireless Rage (Ex): At 17th level and higher, a barbarian no longer becomes fatigued at the end of his rage.

Mighty Rage (Ex): At 20th level, a barbarian''s bonuses to Strength and Constitution during his rage each increase to +8, and his morale bonus on Will saves increases to +4. The penalty to AC remains at –2.

Ex-Barbarians
A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the class (damage reduction, fast movement, trap sense, and uncanny dodge).

Aquatic Barbarian
Barbarians often inhabit wild coasts or travel the open seas. They dwell in regions inhospitable to most humanoids, whether these are fetid jungle isles or the gloomy shores of arctic seas. Barbaric human tribes can be found almost anywhere, and some of them take to a life at sea. Aquatic elves and coastal clans of land-dwelling elves might also be barbarians, while darfellans favor the barbarian class above all others.

Barbarians of the waters and shores are expert in fishing and in following the seasonal movements of marine animals. They might follow migrating whales, taking to skin boats to harpoon the leviathans, or move up and down rivers with the salmon. On outriggers they pursue aquatic monsters, while others line a tidal flat with nets to trap fish when the waters flood in. Such barbarians are always adept swimmers and able to tolerate extended periods in cold water or heavy rain.

Maelstrom barbarians often take to raiding, descending in war canoes or longboats to ravage the shorelines of civilized lands. These reavers are widely feared and form the basis of many terrifying tales.

Fast Movement (Ex): Barbarians who possess a racial swim speed can choose to apply their fast movement bonus to their swim speed instead of their land speed. The choice must be made when the character gains the class feature and cannot be changed later. This benefit still applies only when the barbarian is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load.


Berserker Strength
The decision of when to rage is one of the toughest faced by a barbarian. Selecting the berserker strength class feature in place of rage removes the need for this often complicated tactical decision, replacing it with an automatically activated boost to your combat prowess and durability. In short, when the going gets tough, you get tougher.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain rage (or any later improvements to that class feature).

Benefit: Whenever your current hit point total is below 5 × your barbarian level, your berserker strength automatically activates. You gain a +4 bonus to your Strength score, a +2 bonus on saves, damage reduction 2/-, and a -2 penalty to your AC. The damage reduction granted by berserker strength stacks with any similar kind of damage reduction.

There is no limit to the number of times per day your berserker strength can activate. While berserker strength is active, you have the same limitation on actions as a barbarian in rage. You cannot voluntarily end your berserker strength, although you automatically drop out of it while unconscious, helpless, or (most likely) when you receive healing to bring your current hit points above the threshold.

At 11th level (or if you would gain the greater rage class feature from any class), your berserker strength improves instead. The bonus to your Strength score improves to +6, your bonus on saves improves to +3, and you gain damage reduction 3/- (or your existing damage reduction of the same kind improves by 3).

At 20th level (or if you would gain the mighty rage class feature from any class), your berserker strength instead improves again. The bonus to your Strength score improves to +8, your bonus on saves improves to +4, and you gain damage reduction 4/- (or your existing damage reduction of the same kind improves by 4).

Any effect that would normally apply only during your rage applies whenever your berserker strength is active.

City Brawler
The urban slums you grew up in were as dangerous as any barbarian wilderness.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain proficiency with martial weapons, medium armor, or shields.

Benefit: You gain Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat, as well as the effects of Two-Weapon Fighting feat when fighting unarmed.

At 6th level, you gain the effects of Improved Two-Weapon Fighting when fighting unarmed and at 11th level you gain the effects of Greater Two-Weapon Fighting when fighting unarmed.

You only take a -2 penalty when using improvised weapons (instead of the usual -4 penalty).

Dashing Step
You have mastered the technique of rushing into combat.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the trap sense ability.

Benefit: You do not take a -2 penalty to Armor Class when charging. Furthermore, you add one-third of your barbarian level to your AC against attacks of opportunity when charging.

Devil''s Luck
You make up for your lack of heartiness with astounding luck.

Level: 7th.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain damage reduction.

Benefit: You apply the number of points of damage reduction you would otherwise gain as a luck bonus on all saving throws.


Duskling Barbarian
The duskling''s savage nature lends itself well to life as a barbarian. She channels incarnum to enhance her speed and defense, relying on her race''s natural link to this mystical energy rather than pure physical prowess. Though not quite as tough as a typical barbarian, she makes up for this with her ferocious determination and powers of incarnum.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a duskling barbarian substitution level, a character must be a duskling about to take her 1st, 7th, or 11th level of barbarian.

Class Skills
Duskling barbarian substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard barbarian class, plus Knowledge (the planes).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All of the following are features of the duskling barbarian racial substitution levels.
Incarnum Speed (Su): A duskling barbarian can channel incarnum to dramatically improve her land speed and her ability to react to danger. Every point of essentia invested in this class feature increases the character''s base land speed by 10 feet, but only while wearing medium, light, or no armor and not carrying a heavy load. This is an enhancement bonus, and thus does not stack with a duskling''s racial ability to increase her speed. A duskling barbarian also gains an insight bonus on initiative checks equal to twice the invested essentia.

This benefit replaces a standard barbarian''s fast movement class feature gained at 1st level.

Incarnum Defense (Su): At 7th level, a duskling barbarian gains the ability to use incarnum to protect herself against damage. Investing a point of essentia in this class feature grants damage reduction 1/- and 1 point of resistance to all types of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic); every additional point of essentia invested increases this damage reduction and resistance to energy by 1.

This benefit replaces a standard barbarian''s damage reduction class feature gained at 7th level. A duskling barbarian who selects this substitution level never gains damage reduction from her barbarian class levels.

Incarnum Rage (Su): Beginning at 11th level, when a duskling barbarian enters a rage, she gains 2 points of essentia. This essentia disappears when the rage ends.

This benefit replaces a standard barbarian''s greater rage class feature gained at 11th level. If a duskling barbarian would later gain the mighty rage class feature, she instead gains greater rage.


Table: Duskling Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Illiteracy, incarnum speed, rage 1/day
7th	+7/+2	+5	+2	+2	Incarnum defense
11th	+11/+6/+1	+7	+3	+3	Incarnum rage

Fangshields Barbarian
Barbarians of the Fangshields have few worries about traps, because they spend most of their time in their home territory rather than crawling through dungeons. They train their bodies to their physical peak so they can be the shock troops of the organization, relying on their speed and strength to decimate enemy creatures quickly. Other monsters can fight in formation against massed enemies, but the Fangshields barbarians are skilled at charging opposing monsters and battering them with a few powerful hits.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements
To take a Fangshields barbarian substitution level, a character must be a nonhumanoid creature, be a member of the Fangshields, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 3rd, 5th, or 7th level of barbarian.

Class Skills
Fangshields barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.


Table: Fangshields Barbarian Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
3rd	+3	+3	+1	+1	Fast charge (+10 ft.)
5th	+5	+4	+1	+1	Awesome charge
7th	+7/+2	+5	+2	+2	Raging vigor

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Fangshields barbarian substitution levels.

Fast Charge (Ex): At 3rd level, a Fangshields barbarian gains a 10-foot enhancement bonus to his speed when he charges. This applies to any type of movement the barbarian uses.

This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 3rd level. At any level where a standard barbarian gains a bonus to trap sense (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th), a Fangshields barbarian instead increases the enhancement bonus to his charge speed by 10 feet.

Awesome Charge (Ex): At 5th level, a charging Fangshields barbarian in a rage can make an attack at the end of the charge as if he had the Awesome Blow feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. (Normally, Awesome Blow requires a standard action; this is a specific exception to that rule.)

This benefit replaces the improved uncanny dodge class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 5th level.

Raging Vigor (Ex): At 7th level, a Fangshields barbarian gains the ability to direct his force of will inward, causing his injured body to heal itself. As a standard action, he can spend one of his daily uses of rage to heal damage equal to twice his Hit Dice. He can even use this ability if he is already raging.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian''s damage reduction gained at 7th level. Instead, the Fangshields barbarian gains damage reduction 1/- at 10th level, and his damage reduction is treated as 1 point lower than normal from that point forward.

Fearsome Gaze
Your merest glance can break a man''s will to fight.

Level: 6th.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the indomitable will ability and your trap sense ability is reduced by 1.

Benefit: You gain a +4 bonus on Intimidate checks and can use Strength instead of Charisma as your key ability for Intimidate. You and your target must be within 60 feet and must be able to see one another.

Ferocity
Where most barbarians define themselves by nigh-unstoppable rage, a few streetfighters and urban warriors have mastered different techniques. By working up a surge of adrenaline, they hit just as hard, and substantially faster, than their counterparts, while dodging the inevitable counterattack.

Class: Barbarian.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain rage, or any later improvements to that class feature, nor do you gain indomitable will.

Benefit: Once per day, the barbarian can enter a state of adrenaline-fueled fury, increasing both his physical might and his reaction time. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +4 bonus to Dexterity, but he takes a -2 penalty on ranged attack rolls beyond short range (30 feet).

He can enter this state as an immediate action, even when flat-footed at the start of combat, so he may apply the enhanced Dexterity modifier to his initiative check.

While in a state of ferocity, the barbarian cannot use any Charisma- or Intelligence-based skills (except for Intimidate), the Concentration skill, or any abilities that require patience or concentration, nor can he cast spells or activate magic items that require a command word, a spell trigger (such as a wand), or spell completion (such as a scroll) to function. He can use any feat he has except item creation feats and metamagic feats. Ferocity lasts for a number of rounds equal to 4 + his Constitution modifier (if positive). The barbarian may prematurely end his state of ferocity. At the end of ferocity, he loses the ferocity modifiers and restrictions and become sickened (-2 on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for the duration of the current encounter (unless he is a 17th-level barbarian, at which point this limitation no longer applies). Abilities that normally render him immune to being sickened (such as the Strong Stomach feat) reduce the penalties to -1, but do not remove them entirely.

The barbarian can invoke ferocity only once per encounter. At 1st level he can use this ability once per day. At 4th level and every four levels thereafter, he can use it one additional time per day (to a maximum of six times per day at 20th level).

Greater Ferocity: At 11th level, his bonuses to Strength and Dexterity during ferocity each increase to +6. In addition, the duration of his ferocity increases to 5 + your Constitution modifier (if positive).

Shifting Stance: At 14th level, while in a state of ferocity, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class and Reflex saves.

In addition, while in a state of ferocity, the barbarian can stand from prone as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If a foe that threatens him has a base attack bonus that is 4 points or more higher than his barbarian level, however, she gains an attack of opportunity as normal. (These abilities replace indomitable will.)

Relentless Ferocity: At 17th level, the duration of his ferocity increases to 6 + his Constitution modifier (if positive), and he no longer become sickened at the end of his ferocity. In addition, the dodge bonus granted by his shifting stance ability becomes +2.

Unstoppable Ferocity: At 20th level, the barbarian''s bonuses to Strength and Dexterity during ferocity each increase to +8.

Frostfell Barbarian
Of all the classes, the barbarian is the most at home in the frostfell. The mere fact that civilization has yet to fully colonize vast reaches of the frostfell means that land is plentiful for barbarians to live their nomadic lifestyle. Humans, neanderthals, half-orcs, and orcs comprise the majority of barbarians dwelling in most polar frostfell regions, but this isn''t necessarily the norm. Frostfell barbarians often use dire wolves, megaloceroses, tlalusks, and even woolly mammoths as mounts.

Trap Sense: Barbarians may add their trap sense bonus on Reflex saves made against natural hazards of the frostfell, as well as to their Armor Class against attacks made by natural hazards. Hazards of the frostfell include dangers such as avalanches, snow-filled crevasses, and other terrain features of frostfell terrain.

This ability replaces the benefits a standard barbarian receives from having trap sense.

Golarion Barbarian
Barbarians in the cold climates of the Lands of the Linnorm Kings, the Realm of the Mammoth Lords, and the Worldwound sometimes have the ability below, which replaces the trap sense ability.

Cold Resistance (Ex): At 3rd level, a barbarian gains cold resistance 2. This resistance increases by 2 for every 3 additional levels the barbarian attains, for a total of cold resistance 12 at 18th level.

Goliath Barbarian
The wild, tribal lifestyle of the goliath lends itself naturally to life as a barbarian. Some goliath barbarians tap into the race''s natural connection to the power of the mountains to gain increased strength and durability, but at the cost of some of the barbarian''s traditional agility.

The goliath barbarian can choose three racial substitution levels: one at 1st level, one at 5th level, and the last at 7th level.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements
To take a goliath barbarian substitution level, a character must be a goliath about to take his 1st, 5th, or 7th level of barbarian.

Class Skills
Goliath barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class plus Knowledge (nature) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Goliath Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Fast movement, illiteracy, mountain rage 1/day
5th	+5	+4	+1	+1	Fortification
7th	+7/+2	+5	+2	+2	Skin of stone

Class Features
All the following are features of the goliath barbarian''s racial substitution levels.

Mountain Rage (Ex): A goliath barbarian who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can tap into the mountain''s strength to increase his size and power during a rage. When he rages, his size category increases to Large. (Although his size category increases by one step, the goliath barbarian''s height only increases by a foot or so and his mass only increases by about 30-40%, so his equipment still fits normally.) This change increases the barbarian''s space and reach to 10 feet and applies a -1 penalty on attack rolls and to AC. However, he does not gain additional benefits on weapon size and grapple checks, since he already has them from his powerful build ability.

The goliath barbarian also gains an additional +2 bonus to his Strength when he enters his mountain rage.

Mountain rage replaces the standard barbarian''s rage ability, and when a barbarian would normally gain extra uses of the rage ability per day, he instead gains extra uses of the mountain rage ability. However, the barbarian gains these benefits in addition to the normal benefits and penalties of his rage (+4 Strength, +4 Constitution, +2 on Will saves, and -2 to AC). The barbarian is also still fatigued for the duration of the encounter when his rage ends. If the goliath barbarian''s rage bonuses improve from other effects (such as greater rage), the extra Strength bonus from mountain rage stacks.

Fortification (Ex): A goliath barbarian who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level develops a tough hide that allows him extra protection against potentially devastating attacks. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a goliath barbarian with this substitution benefit, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian''s improved uncanny dodge ability.

Skin of Stone (Ex): A goliath barbarian who takes the 7th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to shrug off some amount of injury from most attacks. He gains damage reduction 2/adamantine. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this damage reduction increases by 2 points.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian''s 7th-level damage reduction ability, as well as the damage reduction gained at higher levels.

Half-Orc Barbarian
Most half-orcs are raised in harsh lands, far from civilization. They tap into their inner anger and power to become devastating berserkers who charge into combat with relish. Those who grew up among orcs are particularly fond of huge, cleaving weapons that can reap terrible destruction. This substitution allows a half-orc barbarian to sacrifice some of his intuitive defenses to become more aggressive in combat.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements
To take a half-orc barbarian substitution level, a character must be a half-orc about to take his 2nd, 5th, or 7th level of barbarian.

Class Skills
Half-orc barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Half-Orc Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
2nd	+2	+3	+0	+0	Reckless charge
5th	+5	+4	+1	+1	Insightful rage
7th	+7/+2	+5	+2	+2	Two-handed strike

Class Features
All the following are features of the half-orc barbarian racial substitution levels.

Reckless Charge (Su): At 2nd level, the half-orc barbarian gains a +4 bonus on attack rolls when making a charge, but takes a -4 penalty to AC. These values replace the normal bonus and penalty accorded to a charging character.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian''s uncanny dodge ability. If the barbarian would later gain improved uncanny dodge as a barbarian class feature, he gains uncanny dodge instead.

Insightful Rage (Ex): While raging, a half-orc barbarian of 5th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on Will saves to disbelieve illusion spells.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian''s improved uncanny dodge ability.

Two-Handed Strike (Ex): The half-orc barbarian focuses his combat talents toward massive, two-handed melee weapons. At 7th level, the half-orc barbarian gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls with any two-handed melee weapon.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian''s damage reduction 1/- gained at 7th level. From this point forward, the half-orc barbarian''s damage reduction is treated as one point less than the noted value (1/- at 10th level, 2/- at 13th level, and so forth).

Halfling Barbarian
Tribal halflings, those who take halfling barbarian substitution levels, are just as dangerous as any other barbarian, but for different reasons. These small warriors can take advantage of their size and slip into areas inaccessible to larger races. When it comes time to stand tall in battle, however, these barbarians prove as tough in combat as any of the bigger races.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements
To take a halfling barbarian substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of barbarian.

Class Skills
Halfling barbarian substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Intelligence modifier.


Table: Halfling Barbarian Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Fast movement, halfling rage 1/day, illiteracy
3rd	+3	+3	+1	+1	Intimidating presence +1
5th	+5	+4	+1	+1	Bigger than life

Class Features
All of the following are features of the halfling barbarian''s racial substitution levels.

Halfling Rage (Ex): Halfling barbarians learn to minimize the impact of their size while in combat. Whenever a halfling barbarian rages, treat him as a Medium creature whenever doing so would be beneficial, such as while in a grapple. While raging, the halfling''s size actually increases slightly, and he therefore loses his +1 size bonus to AC and on attacks. Otherwise, this ability is exactly like the standard rage ability.

Whenever the halfling barbarian gains additional uses of the rage ability, he instead gains additional uses of this ability. Feats that alter the rage ability, such as Extend Rage or Instantaneous Rage, instead alter the halfling rage ability.

This class feature replaces the standard barbarian''s rage ability.

Intimidating Presence (Ex): A halfling barbarian who takes the 3rd-level racial substitution level gains ritualistic scarring and tribal tattoos that make him a frightening sight to behold. Beginning at this level, the halfling barbarian gains a +1 bonus on Intimidate checks. If you are also using the scarification rules presented in the "Ritual Markings" article in DRAGON #340, markings from this ability count as traditional scarring.

This class feature replaces the standard barbarian''s trap sense ability. Whenever the halfling barbarian would otherwise gain an additional +1 to his trap sense ability, he instead gains an additional +1 bonus on Intimidate checks. If the halfling barbarian gains the trap sense ability from another class (such as rogue), that ability functions normally.

Bigger Than Life (Ex): A halfling barbarian who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level makes Intimidate checks as if he were size Medium. If the halfling barbarian is under an effect that actually makes his size Medium (such as an enlarge person spell), this ability has no further impact, but he retains his bonus on Intimidate checks from the intimidating presence ability.

This class feature replaces the standard barbarian''s improved uncanny dodge ability.

Horselord
Few classes are as viscerally satisfying to play as the barbarian. Barbarian rage - that carnival of crushing and screaming, grunting and cleaving that can so quickly reduce a pack of opponents into piles of so much tainted meat - provides a thrill hard to resist. Clearly, the standard barbarian taps into the spirit of Conan and the tales of Viking berserkers: the powerfully built wild man who can enter a frenzied orgy of violence at will.

Historically, not every warrior belonging to a group considered barbaric relied on his physical prowess. Some of history''s most notorious barbarians - Attila the Hun, Arp�d the Magyar King, and Genghis Khan, for instance - hardly reflected Schwarzenegger-esque proportions (Attila was reputed to be quite a small man, in fact). How, then, were they able to loot and pillage just as effectively as their burly Viking colleagues? The answer lies in a contemporary description of the warriors of the Mongol horde: "They were small men on the ground, but they were giants in the saddle."

The horselord is a variant barbarian. Unless otherwise noted, a horselord advances in the same manner as a barbarian (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of barbarian or horselord, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level barbarian twice.

The horselord loses fast movement and trap sense, but gains several new abilities. The horselord does not rage, replacing that ability with a battle ecstasy he can use with the same frequency.

Battle Ecstasy: Traditional cultures from the Celts to the Sioux speak of warriors able - through special prayers, protective garments, or even nakedness in battle - to become invulnerable to the weapons of the enemy. A horselord who enters battle ecstasy becomes difficult to harm. He temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Dexterity, a +4 bonus to Constitution, and damage reduction 1/-. The horselord''s damage reduction while in battle ecstasy stacks with the damage reduction he receives at higher levels (thus, a 7th-level horselord has DR 2/- while in battle ecstasy). A horselord can use any skill or feat while in battle ecstasy, but all skill checks except for Handle Animal and Ride take a -2 penalty. Battle ecstasy lasts as long as a barbarian''s rage and has the same fatiguing effect. Beginning at 17th level, the horselord is no longer fatigued after leaving a battle ecstasy. The horselord''s battle ecstasy has no greater rage or mighty rage equivalents.

Skills: A horselord takes no penalty on Ride checks for riding bareback and gains a +2 bonus when using any kind of saddle (which stacks with the normal +2 bonus on Ride checks when using a military saddle). A horselord must choose a kind of animal he knows of and has ridden as a mount at least once. He receives a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks whenever dealing with the selected kind of animal (most horselords choose the animals their tribes routinely use).

Animal Companion: At 4th level, the horselord''s mount becomes an animal companion as per the ranger abilitiy of the same level. The horselord must own and ride the horse for at least two months before he can bond with it in this way. Treat the mount in all ways as the animal companion of a ranger of the same level as the horselord, except the horselord''s mount retains the animal type and is not considered a magical beast. If the mount is killed or otherwise lost, the horselord can find a new companion mount after 1d4 months of searching and a successful DC 15 Handle Animal check.

Improved Mounted Archery: At 6th level, the horselord gains Improved Mounted Archery as a bonus feat.

Hunter
A barbarian who prefers crafty hunting over pure ferocity might choose to exchange his rage ability for certain ranger class features.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Rage, greater rage, indomitable will, tireless rage, mighty rage.

Gain: Favored enemy (as ranger), archery combat style, improved archery combat style, and archery combat style mastery (as ranger).

Implacable
The toughest dwarven warriors generally become dwarven defenders, but a few find the orderliness of most dwarven cultures a poor fit for their chaotic nature. Over the centuries these rowdy dwarves developed a combat style all their own. They call themselves implacables, and enemies of the dwarves fear their wrath. The implacable fighting style resembles that of many barbarians, but possesses enough subtle differences to make it uniquely dwarven. An implacable, like any barbarian, expends his energy in a short burst of rage, but rather than channel this wrathful energy into an overwhelming assault he channels it into defense.

Implacables study defense first to protect others and only secondarily to protect themselves. An implacable stays alive and in the enemy''s path, letting his allies accomplish their mission. If forced to fight alone he throws all his energy into selling his life dearly. Before he falls, he kills as many of the enemy as possible. Tougher even than a conventional barbarian and as determined as a dwarven defender, a single implacable can hold out against a large number of opponents. A large contingent of these indomitable warriors in the throes of their rage strikes fear into even small armies of foes.

Although dwarves begot the implacables, other races soon discovered their value. Gnomes and humans, trading partners with dwarves and more likely to embrace chaos, soon generated implacables of their own. These nondwarven implacables usually serve as dedicated protectors of their communities, although more than a few have exploited that protective power to make themselves into warlords. Eventually, a few savage humanoids learned to emulate their opponents. Implacables receive less acclaim in orc society than conventional barbarians, but goblins and bugbears embrace the implacable style. These implacables give the savage races the perfect defense against the armies of civilized races.

The implacable is a variant barbarian. Unless otherwise noted, an implacable advances in the same manner as a barbarian (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of barbarian or implacable, he may not later take levels in the other. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level barbarian twice.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: An implacable is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor and shields (except tower shields).

Fast Movement: An implacable does not get the fast movement class feature.

Resilient Rage: An implacable in a resilient rage looks less like a bloodthirsty reckless barbarian and more like an impatient but doggedly determined guardian. He doesn''t gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, his rage more resembles the dwarven defender''s defensive stance, granting him a +4 bonus to Dexterity and Constitution, a +2 bonus on Will saves, and damage reduction 1/-. This temporary damage reduction stacks with the permanent damage reduction the implacable gains at higher levels.

Resilient rage is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all respects. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Dexterity and Constitution bonuses increase to +6, and the temporary damage reduction bonus improves to 2/-. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Dexterity and Constitution bonuses increase to +8, and the temporary damage reduction bonus improves to 3/-.

Natural Born Barbarian
Culture often exerts as strong a pull upon young people as their lineage. Acquiring likes, loathings, special talents, and important insights at their parent''s knee, a body of lore comes to them almost as a birthright. A few, however, follow their own unique paths. They take other ways, scorning the lessons so eagerly sought by their playmates in favor of what they teach themselves. These atypical members of the different races usually band together. Although too rare or new to be true subraces, it is groups such as these that eventually interbreed and develop into their own subsets of the common races. All of the racial traits presented here focus on characters who begin play at 1st level as barbarians, so these alternative racial traits might not work well in a world where the standard races already have "wild" subraces. Given a few generations, however, those with these new racial traits might easily interbreed to such an extent that they form wild subraces.

These new racial traits require a character to begin play as a barbarian and to give up one or more standard racial traits. As elves and half-orcs lack (or have very few) racial traits based on their cultures, they gain compensating drawbacks instead of losing traits they already have.

Because these alternative rules fundamentally alter the way races work, a DM is encouraged to have a careful and thorough understanding of these racial traits before allowing them in her campaign.

Dwarf Barbarian
Let the frail and infirm spend their time fiddling with rocks or shuddering at the tread of orcs and goblins. You sneered at the terrors others felt, never willing to admit to the visions of unnatural creatures haunting your dreams. Now, in moments when your fury bursts forth you rend and tear at what once made you cower under your covers.

These dwarf barbarians lose stonecunning, their bonus on Appraise and Craft checks, and their +1 bonus on attack rolls versus orcs and goblins. In exchange, they gain a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made against aberrations and undead when raging.

Elf Barbarian
Sometimes, even as you outwardly shout and froth at the mouth, you find yourself in the eye of the storm, calm and relaxed while you loose arrow after arrow. Unfortunately, this strange detachment carries a danger too, one that leaves you idly watching as your foes draw nearer.

These elf barbarians gain the use of the Rapid Shot feat while raging even if they Lack the prerequisites. In exchange, they take a -2 penalty on initiative checks.

Gnome Barbarian
You saw no need to talk with useless beasts or to make a spectacle of yourself entertaining fools. As your innate magic developed you displayed abilities to help you overwhelm your enemies.

These gnome barbarians lose their ability to cast speak with animals as well as the other spell-like abilities normally available to their kind. In exchange, they gain the ability to cast cure minor wounds, guidance, jump, and resistance (self only) once each per day. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome''s Charisma modifier + spell level.

Half-Elf Barbarian
They treated you like a freak, an outsider who wasn''t strangled at birth simply out of charity. You fled into the wilderness and while learning to live off the land developed a need for revenge that makes others quail before your anger.

These half-elf barbarians lose their +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks and in exchange gain a +2 bonus on Intimidate and Survival checks.

Half-Orc Barbarian
Let the weak squint over paper. You know the world belongs to the mighty - not the learned. Rather than considering it a drawback you embrace your willful ignorance and turn it to your advantage.

These half-orc barbarians can never learn to read, even if they take levels in other classes, nor may they ever place skill ranks in any Knowledge skill. A half-orc barbarian''s contempt for "book learning" grants him a +2 bonus on all Intimidate and Survival checks.

Halfling Barbarian
While others dangled from trees and romped through the forest you learned to stay perfectly still as your playmates drew near.

These halfling barbarians lose their bonus to Climb, Jump, and Move Silently checks, becoming in exchange extremely adept at camouflage and the art of the ambush. A halfling barbarian gains a bonus on Hide checks made in natural surroundings equal to half her barbarian level (minimum +1).

Planar Barbarian
Barbarians who strike beyond their homeland sometimes find that they go far indeed. Barbarians have no trouble with the dangers, the miles, and the wonders that traveling entails, and planar travel, while more grand, offers a barbarian a chance to refine his abilities with extraplanar enemies in mind.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements
To take a barbarian planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 3rd, 7th, or 11th level of barbarian.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Barbarian planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard barbarian class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.


Table: Barbarian Planar Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
3rd	+3	+3	+1	+1	Portal sense
7th	+7/+2	+5	+2	+2	Planar damage reduction
11th	+11/+6/+1	+7	+3	+3	Menacing rage

Class Features
All of the following are features of the barbarian''s planar substitution levels.

Portal Sense (Su): The barbarian''s raw instincts provide him with a supernatural sense concerning portals, planar breaches, and other passages between planes. A barbarian who takes the 3rd-level planar substitution level instantly becomes aware of any portal within 30 feet of his location, even if such a portal is normally invisible. In a sense, the barbarian seems to "sniff" out the portal. If the barbarian spends a few rounds "sniffing" around (taking a standard action each round to do so), he learns additional information about the portal (the rounds spent analyzing the portal need not be consecutive):

Round 1: Whether the portal is one-way or two-way.

Round 2: Any special circumstances governing the portal''s use, such as knowing that it can be activated only at specific times of the day (but not what those times are) or if a special key or command word is needed to activate the portal (but not what that key or command word is).

Round 3: A brief sense of the area the portal leads to; essentially, the barbarian gains as much information as if he were allowed to see the portal''s destination for 10 seconds, without the benefit of any other sense or analysis.

This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 3rd level. From now on, whenever the barbarian gains a standard barbarian level that grants an improvement to his trap sense, he gains the indicated bonus minus 1 (trap sense +1 at 6th level, trap sense +2 at 9th level, and so on).

Planar Damage Reduction (Ex): The barbarian toughens his body against injuries perpetrated by unnatural creatures. A barbarian who takes the 7th-level planar substitution level gains the ability to shrug off some additional amount of injury from each blow or attack made by an outsider or extraplanar creature. Subtract 2 points from the damage the barbarian takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack made by an outsider or extraplanar creature. In effect, this benefit grants damage reduction 2/- against the attacks of outsiders or extraplanar creatures.

This benefit replaces the damage reduction 1/- gained by a standard barbarian at 7th level. From now on, whenever the barbarian gains a standard barbarian level that grants an improvement to his damage reduction, he gains the indicated amount minus 1 (1/- at 10th level, 2/- at 13th level, and so on). However, the planar damage reduction value stacks with the barbarian''s damage reduction against attacks from outsiders or extraplanar creatures. For example, a 10th-level barbarian would have damage reduction 3/- against outsiders and extraplanar creatures, but damage reduction 1/- against all other creatures.

Menacing Rage (Su): The barbarian gains an especially potent fury against unnatural creatures not native to the Material Plane. A barbarian who takes the 11thlevel planar substitution level generates an intangible aura of danger whenever he rages. This aura weakens hostile outsiders and creatures with the extraplanar subtype within 20 feet. Any outsider or extraplanar creature within that area must attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 barbarian''s class level + barbarian''s Con modifier). Those who fail the saving throw take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, checks, and saves against the barbarian for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting ability. A creature that makes its initial save is not affected by that same barbarian''s menacing rage for 24 hours.

This benefit replaces the greater rage class feature gained by a standard barbarian at 11th level. If the barbarian later qualifies for the mighty rage class feature, he gains greater rage instead.

Relentless Smash
Your powerful attacks can put an opponent in an undesirable state.

Level: 20th.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the mighty rage ability.

Benefit: If you make a successful critical hit against an opponent or strike him at least three times in the same round your opponent is stunned for 1d3 rounds.

Furthermore, if your opponent is your size or smaller he must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + total damage you dealt to him this round) or be knocked prone.

Roof-Dweller
Those who grow up on the streets of the city are often equally at home above the streets, where the rooftops provide an unseen highway.

Class: Barbarian.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain fast movement.

Benefit: The barbarian gains Roofwalker as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the prerequisites.

Additionally, as of 6th level, he need not meet the prerequisites for the Roof-Jumper feat if he chooses to take it, though it is not a bonus feat; the barbarian must still spend a feat slot to acquire it.

Skilled City-Dweller
The various wilderness-oriented skills are valuable indeed, but make less sense - and may prove less useful - for an urban character.

Class: Any class that has one or more of the "skills replaced," as listed below, on its list of class skills.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the "skills replaced" as listed below.

Benefit: The skilled city-dweller gains one or more skills as class skills, at the expense of other skills. If she does not have the proper skill to lose, she cannot gain the skill it grants as an urban benefit.

Note that she need not swap out all these skills. A skilled city-dweller may pick and choose, but she cannot later change her mind.

Skill Replaced	Skill Gained
Handle Animal	Gather Information
Knowledge (nature)	Knowledge (local)
Survival	Sense Motive
Ride	Tumble

Spell Sense
Most barbarians and rogues have a preternatural awareness of danger, whether the threat of a nearby invisible attacker or the hidden peril of a spear trap. Some, however, fine-tune this ability to focus on magical attacks, granting them the ability to dodge the orbs, rays, and eldritch blasts of their enemies.

Class: Barbarian or rogue.

Level: 3rd.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain the trap sense class feature (or any later improvements to that class feature).

Benefit: Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every three barbarian or rogue levels thereafter (to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and so on to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This is an extraordinary ability.

Spiritual Totem
Choose a spiritual totem: bear, eagle, fox, lion, or wolf. Once you do so, you are forever bound to that animal spirit. Your connection grants you special abilities based on the totem you have chosen (or that has chosen you, as some see it).

The DM can add more totems to the above list as desired, using those presented here as guidelines.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the fast movement class feature.

Benefit: You gain one of the abilities described below, depending on the chosen totem. Each of these effects is a supernatural ability.

Bear Totem: The mighty bear is known for her crushing embrace, if you adopt her as your spiritual totem, you gain the improved grab ability.

Eagle Totem: The eagle can see clearly over great distances and often notices details that are not obvious. If you embrace him as your spiritual totem, you gain a +4 bonus on Search and Spot checks.

Fox Totem: The cunning fox uses stealth to gain the upper hand. Should you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain a +4 bonus on Hide and Move Silently checks.

Lion Totem: Regal and intimidating, the powerful lion is a symbol of nobility among the races of the wild. By selecting him as your spiritual totem, you gain the pounce ability.

Wolf Totem: The wolf is a loyal ally who uses pack tactics to subdue her foes. If you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain an additional +2 bonus on attack rolls when flanking an opponent.

Streetfighter
The ability to take a blow is valuable, but on the violent and crowded streets of the city, the winner of a brawl or a duel is often the one who can hit hardest and fastest.

Class: Barbarian.

Level: 7th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain damage reduction at 7th level, or any of the improvements to damage reduction at higher levels.

Benefit: The barbarian gains the ability to swiftly bring the fight to his foe and to hit him hard.

At 7th level, the critical threat range of any charge attack he makes, or any attack he makes against a flat-footed foe, increases by 1. (Thus, a greataxe would threaten a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.) This ability stacks with the Improved Critical feat or the keen weapon enhancement.

At 10th level, the barbarian can make a single turn, up to 90 degrees, during a charge.

At 13th level, the barbarian can charge through squares occupied by his allies or by noncombatants.

At 16th level, the barbarian can move up to four times his speed when making a charge attack, rather than double.

At 19th level, the barbarian acquires a "cleaving charge." If he drops an opponent on a charge attack, and he has at least 10 feet of movement remaining, he can immediately make a new charge attack against a second foe. If he drops that foe and still has movement remaining, he can charge a third, and so on until he either fails to drop a foe, or runs out of movement. All the other standard rules for a charge attack still apply, including the fact that he must have at least 10 feet of distance to make the charge.

Even if he somehow gains the ability to make multiple attacks on a charge (such as with the lion''s charge spell from the Spell Compendium), he must drop the foe on the first attack to use this ability. Similarly, he cannot use this ability and Cleave or Great Cleave in the same round.


Totem Barbarian
In a barbarian-heavy campaign, you can increase the variation between barbarian characters if each barbarian tribe dedicates itself to a different totem creature, such as the bear or the jaguar. The choice of a totem must be taken at 1st level, and cannot be changed later except under extreme circumstances (such as the barbarian being adopted by another tribe).

If you use this variant, the barbarian loses one or more of the following standard class features: fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge. In place of these abilities, the barbarian gains class features as determined by his totem. All totems do not necessarily grant abilities at the same levels, nor do they all grant the same number of abilities. These class features are extraordinary abilities unless otherwise indicated.

The list of totems discussed here is by no means exhaustive. If you prefer to use other totems, you can either substitute the totem name for that of a similar creature (such as changing the Lion Totem to the Tiger Totem) or create a new set of totem abilities, using the information here as a guide.

APE TOTEM CLASS FEATURES
A barbarian dedicated to the ape totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

At 1st level, an ape-totem barbarian gains a climb speed equal to one-half his base land speed (round down to the nearest 5-foot interval). For instance, a human, elf, half-elf, or half-orc ape-totem barbarian has a climb speed of 15 feet, while a dwarf, gnome, or halfling ape-totem barbarian has a climb speed of 10 feet.
At 2nd level, an ape-totem barbarian gains a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.
A 3rd level ape-totem barbarian gains Power Attack as a bonus feat.
At 5th level, an ape-totem barbarian''s climb speed equals his base land speed.
BEAR TOTEM CLASS FEATURES
A barbarian dedicated to the bear totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

A 1st-level bear-totem barbarian gains Toughness as a bonus feat.
At 2nd level, a bear-totem barbarian gains Improved Grapple as a bonus feat, even if he doesn''t meet the normal prerequisites.
A 3rd-level bear-totem barbarian gains Great Fortitude as a bonus feat.
Beginning at 5th level, a bear-totem barbarian gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks when raging.
BOAR TOTEM CLASS FEATURES
A barbarian dedicated to the boar totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

When raging, a 1st-level boar-totem barbarian is treated as having the Diehard feat, even if he doesn''t meet the normal prerequisites.
At 3rd level and higher, a boar-totem barbarian''s rage lasts for 2 rounds longer than normal.
Beginning at 7th level, a boar-totem barbarian''s damage reduction is 1 point higher than the normal value. Thus, at 7th level, a boar-totem barbarian''s damage reduction is 2/-, and it rises by 1 point every three levels thereafter.
DRAGON TOTEM CLASS FEATURES
A barbarian dedicated to the dragon totem does not gain the standard fast movement, uncanny dodge, trap sense, and improved uncanny dodge barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

A 1st-level dragon-totem barbarian gains Blind-Fight as a bonus feat.
At 2nd level, a dragon-totem barbarian gains a +2 bonus on saves against paralysis and sleep effects.
At 5th level, a dragon-totem barbarian gains the frightful presence ability. The save DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 barbarian level + barbarian''s Cha modifier.
EAGLE TOTEM CLASS FEATURES
A barbarian dedicated to the eagle totem does not gain the standard fast movement and trap sense barbarian class features, and instead gains the following abilities.

At 1st level, an eagle-totem barbarian''s keen vision grants him a +2 bonus on Spot checks.
An eagle-totem barbarian gains Lightning Reflexes as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

A 5th-level lion-totem barbarian gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls whenever he charges.
SERPENT TOTEM CLASS FEATURES

A 5th-level wolf-totem barbarian gains Track as a bonus feat.
Totem Manifestation
As the bond between you and your totem grows closer, the spirit of your chosen animal reveals itself more strongly.

Level: 7th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the damage reduction class feature, including all damage reduction increases gained at higher levels of the barbarian class.

Benefit: When you select this ability, your connection to your spiritual totem intensifies. If you have not yet chosen a spiritual totem, you must do so now, but you gain only those abilities described here, not those for the spiritual totem alternative class feature. Each of these effects is a supernatural ability.

Bear Totem: The powerful bear rewards your loyalty. If you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain 1 extra hit point per barbarian level.

Eagle Totem: The keen-eyed eagle grants you low-light vision if you adopt him as your spiritual totem. If you have previously chosen the eagle as your spiritual totem, the bonus on Search and Spot checks increases by 1 at each level at which your damage reduction would increase (10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels).

Fox Totem: The quick fox grants you a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class if you choose her as your spiritual totem. This bonus increases by 1 at each level at which your damage reduction would increase (10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels). Any condition that causes you to lose your Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) also negates this dodge bonus.

Lion Totem: If you select the lion as your spiritual totem, he rewards you with the ability to loose a powerful and intimidating roar. As a standard action, you can roar, requiring every creature within a 30-foot radius to succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your barbarian level + your Str modifier) or be shaken for a number of rounds equal to your barbarian level. This ability can be used once per day, and you gain an additional use per day at each level at which your damage reduction would increase (10th, 13th, 16th, and 19th levels).

Wolf Totem: The wolf is an intelligent hunter who can track her prey with uncanny accuracy and insight. If you choose her as your spiritual totem, you gain Track as a bonus feat. In addition, you gain a +2 sacred bonus on Survival checks.

Trapkiller
You have a knack for avoiding and disabling traps. Your keen instincts help you avoid danger, while your great strength enables you to disrupt dangerous devices.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the trap sense ability.

Benefit: Beginning at 3rd level, you gain trapfinding, except that you can use Survival instead of Search to locate traps. However, you take a -5 penalty on such checks because of your comparative unfamiliarity with the mechanisms and triggers involved.

Once you find a mechanical trap, you can attempt to disarm it by making an attack roll. You succeed if the result exceeds the Disable Device DC of that trap. Only traps with moving mechanisms or gears (such as shifting floor panels, dropping portcullis gates, or arrow traps) can be disarmed in this manner; simple pitfalls and most magic traps have no mechanism to be so disrupted. You must be able to reach the trap with a melee attack to make a disarm attempt. If you fail to disarm the trap, you automatically spring it.

Uncanny Bravery
Many barbarian tribes revere dragons, while others see them as akin to natural disasters. Regardless, some barbarians learn to steel themselves against the bloodcurdling fear that these great beasts can create in weak-minded targets.

This ability also benefits rogues who try to plunder dragon hoards. Although they hope to complete the task without awakening the dragon, only the truly stupid fail to plan for such a possibility.

Class: Barbarian or rogue.

Level: 5th (barbarian) or 8th (rogue).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain improved uncanny dodge.

Benefit: You are immune to the frightful presence of dragons. You gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against all other forms of fear.

Unholy Fury
When a barbarian taps into his buried anger, he unleashes his wrath and turns into a brutal killing machine. Although many barbarians learn to control this violence, some exult in it, reveling in the slaughter they create.

Class: Barbarian.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: To select this alternative class feature, you must be chaotic evil. If your alignment changes to anything else, this ability reverts to the standard rage ability until your alignment is restored to chaotic evil.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the barbarian''s standard fast movement ability.

Benefit: Once during a rage, you can unleash your unholy fury to smite a nonchaotic evil creature. You add your Charisma bonus to your attack roll and deal an extra 1 point of damage per barbarian level. If you accidentally use this ability against a creature that is chaotic evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for the duration of your rage.

Unshakable
You fear nothing.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the improved uncanny dodge ability.

Benefit: You are immune to fear effects.

View the Spirit World
Your link to the divine gives you an uncanny insight into the intricacies of the spirit world. This unique perception lets you expand your senses into realms that few mortals can perceive.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the improved uncanny dodge class feature.

Benefit: Once per day as a swift action, you can peer into the spirit world for a number of rounds equal to one-half your barbarian level (rounded down). While doing so, you gain darkvision out to 60 feet, can see invisible creatures, and gain a +2 bonus on Search and Spot checks. This is a supernatural ability.

Wasteland Barbarian
Barbarians are common in the waste, where survival often comes down to having a few basic skills and the ability to outrun or outfight predators. In very few waste locales is any kind of law enforced - aside from tribal codes and customs - so barbarians are perfectly at home. This variant barbarian gains all the class features of the standard barbarian, except as noted below.

Wastelands Trap Sense (Su): At 3rd level, a waste barbarian adds the bonus from his trap sense class feature to Reflex saves made against natural hazards of the wastes, as well as to his Armor Class against attacks made by natural hazards. Hazards of the wastes include dangers such as lava pools, slipsand, softsand, and other terrain features.

This ability replaces the benefits a standard barbarian receives from having trap sense.

Bonus Feat: A 5th-level waste barbarian gains a bonus feat, which must be drawn from the following list: Blazing Berserker, Endurance, Great Fortitude, Heat Endurance, Improved Heat Endurance, Judged by Aurifar, Sandskimmer, Scorpion''s Resolve, and Self-Sufficient. A wasteland barbarian must meet all the prerequisites for a bonus feat in order to select it.

This ability replaces the standard barbarian''s improved uncanny dodge ability.

Wastelands Damage Reduction (Su): A waste barbarian toughens his body against injuries dealt by the rigors of the wastes. At 8th level, a wasteland barbarian gains damage reduction 1/- against wasteland creatures and hazards. This benefit stacks with the barbarian''s normal damage reduction.

This benefit replaces the standard barbarian''s third daily use of the rage ability gained at 8th level. From this point forward, the waste barbarian can rage one less time per day.


Whirling Frenzy
A barbarian with this variant form of rage doesn''t gain the normal bonuses when he enters a rage. Instead, when a barbarian with whirling frenzy enters a rage, he temporarily gains a +4 bonus to Strength and a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. While in a whirling frenzy, the barbarian may make one extra attack in a round at his highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the barbarian might make before his next action.

Whirling frenzy is otherwise identical to the standard barbarian rage in all other ways. At 11th level (when a standard barbarian gains greater rage), the Strength bonus increases to +6, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +3. At 20th level (when a standard barbarian gains mighty rage), the Strength bonus increases to +8, and the dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves increases to +4.

A barbarian using this variant doesn''t gain indomitable will at 14th level. Instead, he gains evasion, but only while in a whirling frenzy.

A character can''t use whirling frenzy at the same time that he uses any other form of rage (or similar ability).',

    description = 'BARD

It is said that music has a special magic, and the bard proves that saying true. Wandering across the land, gathering lore, telling stories, working magic with his music, and living on the gratitude of his audience - such is the life of a bard. When chance or opportunity draws them into a conflict, bards serve as diplomats, negotiators, messengers, scouts, and spies.

A bard''s magic comes from the heart. If his heart is good, a bard brings hope and courage to the downtrodden and uses his tricks, music, and magic to thwart the schemes of evildoers. If the nobles of the land are corrupt, the good bard is an enemy of the state, cunningly evading capture and raising the spirits of the oppressed. But music can spring from an evil heart as well. Evil bards forego blatant violence in favor of manipulation, holding sway over the hearts and minds of others and taking what enraptured audiences "willingly" give.

Bards see adventures as opportunities to learn. They practice their many skills and abilities, and they especially relish the opportunity to enter a long-forgotten tomb, to discover ancient works of magic, to decipher old tomes, to travel to strange places, to encounter exotic creatures, and to learn new songs and stories. Bards love to accompany heroes (and villains), joining their entourage to witness their deeds firsthand - a bard who can tell a marvelous story from personal experience earns renown among his fellows. Indeed, after telling so many stories about heroes doing mighty deeds, many bards take these themes to heart and assume heroic roles themselves.

A bard brings forth magic from his soul, not from a book. He can cast only a small number of spells, but he can do so without selecting or preparing them in advance. His magic emphasizes charms and illusions over the more dramatic evocation spells that wizards and sorcerers often use.

In addition to spells, a bard works magic with his music and poetry. He can encourage allies, hold his audiences rapt, and counter magical effects that rely on speech or sound.

Bards have some of the skills that rogues have, although bards they are not as focused on skill mastery as rogues are. A bard listens to stories as well as telling them, of course, so he has a vast knowledge of local events and noteworthy items.

Bards are wanderers, guided by whim and intuition rather than by tradition or law. The spontaneous talent, magic, and lifestyle of the bard are incompatible with a lawful alignment.

Bards revere Fharlanghn (god of roads). They sometimes camp near his wayside shrines, hoping to earn some coin from the travelers who stop to leave offerings for the god. Many bards, even those who are not elves, worship Corellon Larethian, god of elves and patron of poetry and music. Many good bards are partial to Pelor (god of the sun), believing that he watches over them in their travels. Bards given to chaos and occasional larceny favor Olidammara (god of thieves). Those who have turned to evil ways are known to worship Erythnul (the god of slaughter), though few will admit to it. In any event, bards spend so much time on the road that, while they may be devoted to a deity, they are rarely devoted to any particular temple.

An apprentice bard learns his skills from a single experienced bard, whom he follows and serves until he is ready to strike out on his own. Many bards were once young runaways or orphans, befriended by wandering bards who became their mentors. Since bards occasionally congregate in informal "colleges," the apprentice bard may meet many of the more prominent bards in the area. Still, the bard has no strong allegiance to bards as a whole. In fact, some bards are highly competitive with other bards, jealous of their reputations and defensive

Bards are commonly human, gnome, elf, or half-elf. Humans take well to the wandering life and adapt easily to new lands and customs. Gnomes have a sense of humor and trickery that lends itself to a bardic career. Elves are talented in music and magic, so the career of the bard comes naturally to them. A bard''s wandering ways suit many half-elves, who often feel like strangers even when at home.

Half-orcs, even those raised among humans, find themselves ill suited to the demands of a bard''s career. There are no bardic traditions among dwarves, or halflings, though occasional individuals of these races find teachers to train them in the ways of the bard. Bards are exceedingly rare among the savage humanoids, except among centaurs. Centaur bards sometimes train the children of humans or other humanoids.

A bard works well with companions of other classes. He often serves as the spokesman of the party, using his social skills for the party''s benefit. In a party without a wizard or sorcerer, the bard contributes his magic. In a party without a rogue, he uses his skills. A bard is curious about the ways of more focused or dedicated adventurers, so he often tries to pick up pointers from fighters, sorcerers, and rogues.

The bard is perhaps the ultimate generalist. In most adventuring groups, he works best in a supporting role. He can''t usually match the stealth of the ranger or the rogue, the spellcasting power of the cleric or the wizard, or the combat prowess of the barbarian or the fighter. However, he makes all the other characters better at what they do, and he can often fill in for another character when needed. For a typical group of four characters, the bard is perhaps the most useful fifth character to consider adding, and he can make a great team leader.

Alignment: Any nonlawful.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the bard.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A bard is proficient with all simple weapons, plus the longsword, rapier, sap, short sword, shortbow, and whip. Bards are proficient with light armor and shields (except tower shields). A bard can cast bard spells while wearing light armor without incurring the normal arcane spell failure chance. However, like any other arcane spellcaster, a bard wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield incurs a chance of arcane spell failure if the spell in question has a somatic component (most do). A multiclass bard still incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance for arcane spells received from other classes.

Spells: A bard casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the bard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time. Every bard spell has a verbal component (singing, reciting, or music).

To learn or cast a spell, a bard must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a bard''s spell is 10 + the spell level + the bard''s Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a bard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Bard. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score. When Table: Bard Spells Known indicates that the bard gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Charisma score for that spell level.

The bard''s selection of spells is extremely limited. A bard begins play knowing four 0-level spells of your choice. At most new bard levels, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Bard Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a bard knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Bard Spells Known are fixed.)

Upon reaching 5th level, and at every third bard level after that (8th, 11th, and so on), a bard can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the bard "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell''s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level bard spell the bard can cast. A bard may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

As noted above, a bard need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his allotment of spells per day for the spell''s level.

Bardic Knowledge: A bard may make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to his bard level + his Intelligence modifier to see whether he knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or noteworthy places. (If the bard has 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (history), he gains a +2 bonus on this check.)

A successful bardic knowledge check will not reveal the powers of a magic item but may give a hint as to its general function. A bard may not take 10 or take 20 on this check; this sort of knowledge is essentially random.

DC	Type of Knowledge
10	Common, known by at least a substantial minority drinking; common legends of the local population.
20	Uncommon but available, known by only a few people legends.
25	Obscure, known by few, hard to come by.
30	Extremely obscure, known by very few, possibly forgotten by most who once knew it, possibly known only by those who don''t understand the significance of the knowledge.
Bardic Music: Once per day per bard level, a bard can use his song or poetics to produce magical effects on those around him (usually including himself, if desired). While these abilities fall under the category of bardic music and the descriptions discuss singing or playing instruments, they can all be activated by reciting poetry, chanting, singing lyrical songs, singing melodies, whistling, playing an instrument, or playing an instrument in combination with some spoken performance. Each ability requires both a minimum bard level and a minimum number of ranks in the Perform skill to qualify; if a bard does not have the required number of ranks in at least one Perform skill, he does not gain the bardic music ability until he acquires the needed ranks.

Starting a bardic music effect is a standard action. Some bardic music abilities require concentration, which means the bard must take a standard action each round to maintain the ability. Even while using bardic music that doesn''t require concentration, a bard cannot cast spells, activate magic items by spell completion (such as scrolls), or activate magic items by magic word (such as wands). Just as for casting a spell with a verbal component, a deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use bardic music. If he fails, the attempt still counts against his daily limit.

Countersong (Su): A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that depend on sound (but not spells that simply have verbal components). Each round of the countersong, he makes a Perform check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard''s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a noninstantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard''s Perform check result for the save. Countersong has no effect against effects that don''t allow saves. The bard may keep up the countersong for 10 rounds.

Fascinate (Sp): A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and able to pay attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creature. The distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability.

To use the ability, a bard makes a Perform check. His check result is the DC for each affected creature''s Will save against the effect. If a creature''s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and listens to the song, taking no other actions, for as long as the bard continues to play and concentrate (up to a maximum of 1 round per bard level). While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Listen and Spot checks. Any potential threat requires the bard to make another Perform check and allows the creature a new saving throw against a DC equal to the new Perform check result.

Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a ranged weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect. Fascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability.

Inspire Courage (Su): A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire courage in his allies (including himselfs), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to hear the bard sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by 1 (+2 at 8th, +3 at 14th, and +4 at 20th). Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability.

Inspire Competence (Su): A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The bard must also be able to see the ally.

The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as he or she continues to hear the bard''s music. Certain uses of this ability are infeasible. The effect lasts as long as the bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can''t inspire competence in himself. Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability.

Suggestion (Sp): A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make a suggestion (as the spell) to a creature that he has already fascinated (see above). Using this ability does not break the bard''s concentration on the fascinate effect, nor does it allow a second saving throw against the fascinate effect.

Making a suggestion doesn''t count against a bard''s daily limit on bardic music performances. A Will saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 bard''s level + bard''s Cha modifier) negates the effect. This ability affects only a single creature (but see mass suggestion, below). Suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language dependent ability.

Inspire Greatness (Su): A bard of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire greatness in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet, granting him or her extra fighting capability. For every three levels a bard attains beyond 9th, he can target one additional ally with a single use of this ability (two at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th). To inspire greatness, a bard must sing and an ally must hear him sing. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. A creature inspired with greatness gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (apply the target''s Constitution modifier, if any, to these bonus Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells that are Hit Dice dependant. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability.

Song of Freedom (Sp): A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect equivalent to the break enchantment spell (caster level equals the character''s bard level). Using this ability requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration and music, and it functions on a single target within 30 feet. A bard can''t use song of freedom on himself.

Inspire Heroics (Su): A bard of 15th level or higher with 18 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to inspire tremendous heroism in himself or a single willing ally within 30 feet. For every three bard levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can inspire heroics in one additional creature. To inspire heroics, a bard must sing and an ally must hear the bard sing for a full round. A creature so inspired gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws and a +4 dodge bonus to AC. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Inspire heroics is a mind-affecting ability.

Mass Suggestion (Sp): This ability functions like suggestion, above, except that a bard of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can make the suggestion simultaneously to any number of creatures that he has already fascinated (see above). Mass suggestion is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting, language-dependent ability.

Bardic Knack
Wandering bards learn more mundane skills and less esoteric knowledge on their travels. If you select this class feature, you have done a little bit of everything; maybe you spent a few months as a wilderness guide, and you also had a cousin in an ambassador''s retinue who regaled you with tales of courtly intrigue.

The bardic knack class feature makes you more capable of accomplishing simple tasks with a wide variety of skills. You don''t need to dabble in noncritical skills (unless you want to be considered trained in their use), freeing up your skill points to focus on a small range of crucial skills.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain bardic knowledge.

Benefit: When making any skill check, you can use 1/2 your bard level (rounded up) in place of the number of ranks you have in the skill (even if that number is 0). For example, a 5th-level bard would have the equivalent of 3 ranks in Appraise, Balance, Bluff, and so on (but only for the purpose of making skill checks).

You can''t take 10 on checks when you use bardic knack (to take 10 you have to use your actual ranks). If the skill doesn''t allow untrained checks, you must have at least 1 actual rank to attempt the check.

Bardic Sage
The bardic sage focuses his efforts on learning, research, and the power of knowledge.

Alignment: The bardic sage must be neutral good, neutral, or neutral evil. The true pursuit of knowledge cares little for ethical extremes. A bardic sage who becomes chaotic or lawful cannot progress in levels as a bardic sage, though he retains all his bardic sage abilities.

Base Save Bonuses: The bardic sage has good will saves, but has poor Fortitude and Reflex saves.

Class Features
The bardic sage has all the standard bard class features, except as noted below.

Spellcasting: A bardic sage learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with a few exceptions. In addition to the normal number of spells known, a bardic sage knows one divination spell of each spell level he is capable of casting. For example, a 1st-level bardic sage knows four 0-level bard spells plus one 0-level bard spell of the divination school (such as detect magic, know direction, or read magic). The bardic sage''s number of spells per day does not change.

To learn or cast a spell, a bardic sage must have an intelligence score (not Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level. All other spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs, are still determined using the bardic sage''s Charisma score. Add the following spells to the bardic sage''s class spell list:�

1st - detect chaos/evil/good/law;�

2nd - zone of truth;�

3rd - arcane sight;�

4th - analyze dweomer (lowered from 6th), sending;�

5th - contact other plane, greater scrying (lowered from 6th);�

6th - true seeing, vision.

Bardic Knowledge: A bardic sage gains a +2 bonus on all bardic knowledge checks.

Bardic Music: A bardic sage''s powers of inspiration are not as persistent as those of a traditional bard. His ability to inspire courage, inspire greatness, or inspire heroics lasts only 3 rounds after the ally can no longer hear the bardic sage sing, rather than the normal 5 rounds.

Dead Levels
The bard has ten dead levels but gains spells per day and spells known during each one of those levels (which can be considered special abilities in their own right). Still, certain prestige classes grant +1 level of arcane spellcasting at every level along with powerful abilities to boot. This means that minor abilities are permissible during each dead level.

Rally Performance (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a bard hones his skill as a public musician and can reroll a Perform check once per day, but only when attempting to impress audiences for the purpose of earning money. A bard must take the result of the reroll, even if it''s worse than the original roll. See the Perform skill description.

Refine Performance (Ex): At 4th level, a bard learns how to make his performances more appealing to the public of a prosperous city and is considered to have rolled at least a 2 on each d10 or d6 when determining how much money was earned each day from a Perform check. See the Perform skill description. At 5th, 7th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 16th, and 17th level, a bard is considered to have rolled 1 number higher on each d10 (for example, a least 3 at 5th level, at least 4 at 7th level, etc.). By extension, a bard is considered to have rolled at least 3 on each d6 at 7th level, at least 4 at 11th level, and at least 5 at 16th level. At 19th level, a bard earns the maximum amount of money for his performance.

Divine Bard
Not all bards are arcanists; some derive their special powers from a divine tradition. In many primitive cultures, the divine bard takes the place of the cleric or the adept as the guide of the people''s religious beliefs.

Class Features
The divine bard has all the standard bard class features, except as noted below.

Spellcasting: A divine bard learns and casts spells as a normal bard, with some minor exceptions. A divine bard''s spells are divine spells, not arcane spells.

To learn or cast a spell, a divine bard must have a Wisdom score (not Charisma score) equal to at least 10 + the spell level. All other Spellcasting factors, including bonus spells and save DCs, are still determined using the divine bard''s Charisma score.

Like druids, paladins, and rangers, divine bards need not designate a specific deity as the source of their spells. However, a divine bard can''t cast spells of an alignment that doesn''t match his. Thus, divine bards cannot cast lawful spells (since bards can''t be lawful). Neutral divine bards can''t cast any spells associated with an alignment (and are thus relatively rare).

Add the following spells to the divine bard''s class spell list:�

0 - create water, cure minor wounds;�

1st - detect evil/good/law, protection from evil/good/law;�

2nd - consecrate, desecrate, gentle repose;�

3rd - magic circle against evil/good/law, prayer;�

4th - remove disease, speak with dead, sending;�

5th - divination, restoration;�

6th - commune, hallow, unhallow, raise dead.

Drow Bard
When adventurers think of drow arcanists, they picture the horrifically deadly drow wizards or the demonically imbued warlocks. The bard would almost certainly be at the bottom of the list of arcane classes associated with the drow. What surfacedwellers fail to realize, however, is that the drow have an ancient bardic tradition - one that transforms the traveling entertainer, trickster, and storyteller of the surface into one of the most horrific taskmasters and assassins of the Underdark.

Deadly Knowledge
Drow bards do not travel the world, and thus do not gain the broad range of understanding other bards have. Instead, they study a means of death-dealing normally associated with other classes.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard bard''s bardic knowledge ability. In addition, you can use your bardic music one fewer time per day than other bards (minimum 1).

Benefit: You are trained in the use of poison. You never risk poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.

Fey Bard
A rare bard might display a special link to nature and the mysterious world of the fey. Such characters tend to be more aloof and less inspiring than standard bards.
This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Bardic knowledge, inspire courage, inspire competence, inspire greatness, inspire heroics.

Gain: Animal companion (as druid), nature sense (as druid), resist nature''s lure (as druid), wild empathy (as druid).

Gnome Bard
Weavers of illusion and subtle masters of the sentient mind, gnome bards focus their talents toward abilities related to their racial strengths. Their magic includes access to more illusions than other bards can master, and their bardic music is able to inspire or negate fear, as well as bolster allies'' minds against outside influence.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a gnome bard substitution level, a character must be a gnome about to take his 1st, 3rd, 6th, or 11th level of bard.

Class Skills
Gnome bard substitution levels have the class skills of the standard bard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Gnome Bard Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+0	+0	+2	+2	Bardic music, bardic knowledge, gnome cantrips, counter fear, fascinate, inspire courage +1	Same as bard
3rd	+2	+1	+3	+3	Inspire defiance	Same as bard
6th	+4	+2	+5	+5	Phantasmal song	Same as bard
11th	+8/+3	+3	+7	+7	Secrets of bardic trickery	See text
Class Features
All the following are features of the gnome bard''s racial substitution levels.

Gnome Cantrips: A gnome bard who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level adds the following 0-level spells to his bard spells known: dancing lights, ghost sound, and prestidigitation.

This benefit replaces two of the cantrips a bard normally knows at 1st level. Thus, a 1st-level gnome bard with this substitution level knows two cantrips of his choice plus the three mentioned here.

Counter Fear (Su): A gnome bard who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level and has 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to counter magical effects that cause fear. In each round when the bard uses his counter fear ability, he makes a Perform check. Any ally within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a fear effect can use the bard''s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the counter fear effect is already under the influence of a fear effect, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the bard perform, but it must use the bard''s Perform check result for the save. Counter fear has no effect against effects that don''t allow saves. The bard can keep up the counter fear ability for 10 rounds.

This substitution feature replaces the base bard''s countersong bardic music ability.

Inspire Defiance (Su): A gnome bard who takes the 3rd-level racial substitution level and has 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to help his allies (including himself) resist outside control and discern truth from illusion. To be affected, an ally must be within 30 feet and able to hear the bard perform. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the bard perform and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally receives a +2 circumstance bonus on saving throws against illusions and mind-affecting spells and effects.

This benefit replaces the standard bard''s inspire competence bardic music ability.

Phantasmal Song (Su): A gnome bard who takes the 6th-level racial substitution level and has 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an eerie melody with phantasmal echoes in the minds of those who hear it. While the music itself is unsettling, the phantasmal component is downright terrifying, with effects that build as the bard continues to play. Enemy creatures within 30 feet of the bard who can hear the music become shaken (Will negates; DC 10 + 1/2 bard''s level + bard''s Cha modifier). Any creature affected by phantasmal song (that is, who failed the initial Will save) that remains within range and hears the song for at least 3 consecutive rounds becomes frightened instead of shaken. The effect lasts as long as the bard performs and for 1 round after he stops, or until the affected creature moves more than 30 feet from the gnome bard.

The effects of multiple phantasmal songs do not stack with one another. Thus, a creature within the area of two phantasmal songs must save against both, but can still only become shaken on the first round even if it fails both saves. However, a phantasmal song''s effect can stack with other fear effects (such as from the cause fear spell). See Fear under Special Abilities for more information on fear effects. Phantasmal song is an illusion (phantasm), mind-affecting fear effect.

This benefit replaces the standard bard''s suggestion bardic music ability.

Secrets of Bardic Trickery: A gnome bard who takes the 11th-level racial substitution level adds the following spells to his spells known: 1st - color spray; 2nd - touch of idiocy; 4th - phantasmal killer.

This benefit replaces the standard bard''s ability to learn a new 4th-level spell at 11th level and his ability to exchange a spell he knows for a new spell of the same level. From now on, the gnome bard''s number of 4th-level spells known is one fewer than the value shown on Table: Bard Spells Known.

Golarion Bard
Bards trained at one of the great schools of the Inner Sea tend to favor one performance type above all others, focusing their training. Such bards have the above ability, which replaces bardic knowledge.

Specialized Training (Ex): At 1st level, a bard must choose a single category of the Perform skill. Whenever the bard performs bardic music using the chosen category of the Perform skill, he is treated as being 2 levels higher when determining the effect and save DC. In addition, a bard with specialized training can make use of his bardic music one additional time per day, assuming that the additional usage uses his chosen category of the Perform skill.

Half-Elf Bard
Blessed with a smooth grace and demeanor that many find appealing, the half-elf bard is a common sight. The half-elf bard gives up some of her performance abilities to become more well versed in social interaction and negotiation.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a half-elf bard substitution level, a character must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 6th, or 8th level of bard.

Class Skills
Half-elf bard substitution levels have the class skills of the standard bard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Half-Elf Bard Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+0	+0	+2	+2	Bardic music, bardic knowledge, fascinate, inspire courage +1, soothing voice	Same as bard
6th	+4	+2	+5	+5	Command	Same as bard
8th	+6/+1	+2	+6	+6	Inspire courage +2, secrets of the diplomat	See text
Class Features
All the following are features of the half-elf bard''s racial substitution levels.

Soothing Voice (Su): A 1st-level half-elf bard with 3 or more ranks in Diplomacy can spend one daily use of her bardic music to use a composed, steady voice and reason to calm the emotions in others around her. This ability works in much the same way as the half-elf bard''s fascinate ability, with the following differences.

The creature to be soothed must be within 30 feet of the bard and must be able to understand the language she is speaking. To use this ability, the half-elf bard makes a Diplomacy check. Her check result is the DC for each affected creature''s Will save against the effect. On a success, the creature is affected as if by the calm emotions spell. The effect lasts as long as the creature listens to the bard, although the creature may wander off on its own if there is nothing to keep its interest.

This benefit replaces the standard bard''s ability of countersong.

Command (Sp): A 6th-level half-elf bard with at least 9 ranks in Diplomacy may spend one daily use of her bardic music to issue a command (as the spell) to a creature within 30 feet. Alternatively, the command can affect all creatures that the bard has affected with her soothing voice or fascinate ability. A Will saving throw (DC 11 + bard''s Cha modifier) negates the effect.

This benefit replaces the standard bard''s ability of suggestion.

Secrets of the Diplomat: At 8th level, a half-elf bard adds the following spells to her spells known: 1st - command; 2nd - zone of truth; 4th - sending.

This benefit replaces the 4th-level spell learned by a standard bard at 8th level. From now on, the bard knows one fewer 4th-level bard spell than normal (not counting the spells she learned from this substitution feature).

Harbinger
The harbinger reverses the fundamental power of bardic music to create darkness and doubt where the standard bard brightens the world with joyful melodies and uplifting tunes. He uses a form of bardic music ability designed to destroy the morale of others and lead them to destruction. The harbinger taps into the dark side of his art, bringing out the worst fears and insecurities in those around him.

The harbinger is a variant bard. Unless otherwise noted, a harbinger advances in the same manner as a bard (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of bard or harbinger, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level bard twice.

Alignment: Any nonlawful and nongood.

Class Features
All the following are class features for the harbinger.

Bardic Music: The harbinger''s bardic music abilities differ from those of the standard bard. Unless otherwise noted a harbinger''s bardic music abilities allow a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 harbinger level + Charisma modifier).

Instill Fear (Su): A harbinger with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to instill fear into his enemies, weakening them against fear and wor sening their combat abilities. The harbinger must be able to see his targets and be seen or heard by them. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the harbinger sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected enemy takes a -1 penalty on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 8th level, and every six harbinger levels thereafter, this penalty increases by 1 (-2 at 8th, -3 at 14th, and -4 at 20th). Instill fear is a mind-affecting fear effect.

Encourage Failure (Su): A harbinger of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to cause one enemy to fail at a task. The enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the harbinger. The harbinger must also be able to see the enemy. The affected target takes a -2 penalty on all rolls for 1 round. Encourage failure is a mind-affecting ability.

Dishearten (Su): A harbinger of 9th level or higher with 12 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to dishearten a single enemy within 30 feet, causing the enemy to cower even against the weakest foe. For every three harbinger levels the character attains beyond 15th, he can dishearten one additional creature. To dishearten, a harbinger must sing and the enemy must hear the harbinger sing for a full round. A creature so affected takes a -4 penalty on saving throws and AC. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the harbinger sing and for up to 5 rounds thereafter. Dishearten is a mind-affecting ability.

Dirge of Binding (Sp): A harbinger of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use music or poetics to create an effect that paralyzes one target. The effect lasts as long as the creature can hear the harbinger.

Drain Prowess (Su): A harbinger of 18th level or higher with 21 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use his music or poetics to drain prowess from up to four enemies within 30 feet, weakening their skills and fighting capabilities. For every three levels a harbinger attains beyond 18th, he can target one additional enemy with a single use of this ability. To be affected the enemies must be able to hear the harbinger sing. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the harbinger sing. A creature drained of prowess gains two negative levels. These negative level remains as long as the target creature can hear the harbinger. They never result in a permanent level loss.

Healing Hymn
When you play your healing hymn, your allies can cast curative spells more effectively. Furthermore, everyone around you feels rejuvenated and more fully rested when your hymn becomes a lullaby.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the fascinate bardic music ability.

Benefit: If you have 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill, you can use your music or poetics to create an area conducive to healing.

To be affected, an ally must be able to see and hear you perform. The effect lasts as long as you continue performing and for 5 rounds thereafter. An affected ally who casts any conjuration (healing) spell gains a +1 sacred (if you''re good or neutral) or profane (if you''re evil) bonus on the roll for each rank you have in the Perform skill. This ability has no effect on spells cast from wands, scrolls, or other magic items. This bonus is limited by the maximum caster level bonus of a curing spell. For example, if a level 10 cleric cast cure serious while under the effect of healing hymn used by a bard with 10 ranks in perform, the cure serious spell would only cure 3d8+15 instead of 3d8+20.

In addition, if you use this ability for at least 1 minute before you and your allies retire for the night, everyone in the group heals naturally at the end of the rest as if he had completed 24 hours of best rest (thus recovering twice his character level in hit points). If the music is interrupted, the magic of the song is lost.

Either use of healing hymn counts as one daily use of your bardic music ability. This is a spell-like ability. Healing hymn lasts as long as you concentrate up to a maximum of 2 minutes.

Hymn of Fortification
By singing praises to the holy powers, you can cloak yourself or an ally in a protective sheath of sound. This effect protects the subject from supernatural creatures, as well as their malign powers.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the inspire competence bardic music ability.

Benefit: If you are a 3rd-level or higher bard with 6 or more ranks in Perform (oratory) or Perform (sing), you can grant protection from supernatural creatures. This effect fortifies you or a single chosen ally within 30 feet against mental control and attacks from evil-aligned or summoned creatures. In most respects, hymn of fortification mirrors the effects of the protection from evil spell. If you wish to protect an ally with this ability, the two of you must be able to see and hear each other. The effect lasts as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 2 minutes.

Each use of hymn of fortification counts as one daily use of your bardic music ability. This is a spell-like ability.

Inspire Awe
Though occasionally derided as the "weak cousin" of the sorcerer, a bard can tap into a fragment of the same draconic power that fuels sorcerer magic. A bard who learns this ability no longer inspires courage in his allies, but instead creates fear in those who oppose him.

Class: Bard.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain inspire courage (or any later improvements to that class feature).

Benefit: A bard with 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill can use song or poetics to inspire awe in his enemies, rendering them shaken. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and be able to hear the bard perform. The effect lasts for as long as the enemy hears the bard perform and for 1 round thereafter. Each enemy can attempt a Will save to negate the effect; the DC is equal to the bard''s Perform check result. Regardless of the success or failure of the save, no creature can be affected by inspire awe more than once in a 24-hour period. Inspire awe is a mind-affecting fear effect.

At 8th level, the range of this effect extends to 60 feet.

At 14th level, the effect lasts for 5 rounds after the enemy can no longer hear the bard perform.

At 20th level, any enemy who fails to save becomes frightened for 1 round, then shaken for the remainder of the duration.

Inspire Hatred
Motivated by a desire to spread havoc and sow discord, some villainous bards abandon the techniques that inspire heroes to greatness. Instead, they prey upon secret longings and buried frustrations to awaken the hate that resides in mortal hearts.

Class: Bard.

Level: 9th.

Special Requirement: You must have 12 ranks in a Perform skill to use this ability.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the bardic music ability to inspire greatness.

Benefit: You can use music, poetics, or fiery oratory to evoke hatred in a single living creature within 30 feet that has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher. For every three levels you attain beyond 9th, you can target one additional creature with a single use of this ability (two creatures at 12th level, three at 15th, four at 18th, and so on). To inspire hatred, you must sing, speak, or perform, and the target must hear you. The target is entitled to a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your bard level + your Cha modifier) to resist this mind-affecting ability. The effect lasts for as long as the target hears you and for 5 additional rounds thereafter.

An affected creature develops an unreasoning hatred of another creature that you indicate. The affected creature attacks the object of its hate as directed, to the exclusion of other opponents. If the affected creature is attacked, it can defend itself as normal, but as soon as possible, it resumes attacking the object of its hate.

Creatures compelled to attack an ally can attempt a new Will save each round to break free from this supernatural effect.

Inspire Turning
You use your knowledge of religious hymns and divine song to lend greater energy to an ally''s turn undead attempt.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the inspire competence bardic music ability.

Benefit: You can expend one daily use of your bardic music to help an ally who attempts to turn undead (or destroy undead, if a lightbringer cleric). The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear you. You must also be able to see the ally. The ally is treated as being two levels higher than his actual level for the purpose of turning undead as long as he or she continues to hear your performance. The effect lasts as long as you concentrate, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. You can''t use inspire turning on yourself. This is a supernatural, mind-affecting ability.

Lore Song
Bardic music serves many purposes, aiding your allies or manipulating your enemies. You have refined your performance of another group of bardic songs, full of lost knowledge, obscure lore, and relevant anecdotes. These lore songs inspire you to come up with new solutions to difficult problems.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the bardic knowledge ability.

Benefit: Once per day, as an immediate action, you can gain a +4 insight bonus on a single attack, check, or save. You gain one additional daily use of this ability at every odd-numbered bard level (3rd, 5th, and so on).

Mimicking Song
You use your bardic music to create background noise consistent with your adventuring environment, shielding the sounds made by yourself and your adventuring party as you move through dangerous areas.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the countersong bardic music ability.

Benefit: Mimicking song is a spell-like ability that requires you to have 3 or more ranks in a Perform skill. Using mimicking song counts as one of your daily uses of bardic music. You grant a +2 bonus on the Move Silently check of all allies within 30 feet (including yourself). This bonus increases by 2 for every five bard levels you have (to a maximum bonus of +10 at 20th level). This effect lasts as long as you continue performing.

Music of Creation
Bards have a unique way of tapping into the magic that pervades Eberron: through music. Some bards claim that the Dragon Above sang the world into being at the dawn of time, and that their music is an echo of that powerful tune of creation.

Reflecting this connection to the forces of creation, bards have access to a number of feats that extend the powers of their bardic music. A bard can take these feats any time she would normally gain a feat, or can choose one of them as a bonus feat instead of gaining a new form of bardic music at 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, or 18th level.

These bard feats are Haunting Melody, Music of Growth, Music of Making, Song of the Heart, and Soothe the Beast.

Planar Bard
Some hold that if one had the eyes to see, the world would be revealed as a symphony of celestial music, each theme playing out its part on the stage of reality. For some bards, this intuition is true. When they let the scales slip from their eyes, they see the underlying overture of music that connects all levels of reality. With this knowledge, they gain some ability to add refrains of their own choosing. This fine-tuning bypasses spellcasting and directly affects what others see as reality.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a bard planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 3rd, 6th, or 12th level of bard.
The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Bard planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard bard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.


Table: Bard Planar Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
3rd	+2	+1	+3	+3	Planar inspiration	Same as bard
6th	+4	+2	+5	+5	Portal dissonance	Same as bard
12th	+9/+4	+4	+8	+8	Planar discordance	Same as bard
Class Features
All of the following are features of the bard''s planar substitution levels. Each benefit takes the place of one of the standard bardic music abilities and costs one daily use of bardic music.

Planar Inspiration (Su): A bard of 3rd level or higher with 6 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefit can use his music or poetics to protect his allies from the alignment traits of a plane. The bard must perform for a full minute, spending a standard action to concentrate on his performance each round. At the end of the performance, he makes a Perform check (DC 15 for mild alignment traits, or DC 25 for strong alignment traits). The bard can''t take 10 on this check.

Success indicates that the bard and each ally within 30 feet who heard the bard perform for the full minute don''t take the normal penalty on checks made on planes whose alignments differ from their own (see Alignment Traits) for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting ability.

This benefit replaces the inspire competence bardic music ability gained by a standard bard at 3rd level.

Portal Dissonance (Su): A bard of 6th level or higher with 9 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefit can use music or poetics to influence intraplanar and extraplanar portals, moderate or severe planar breaches, and other discrete passages between planes (complete planar breaches cannot be affected). The portal, breach, or other qualifying passage to be affected must be centered within 60 feet. The bard must know about the portal.

Each round of the performance, he attempts a DC 20 Perform check. The bard can''t take 10 on this check. Success indicates that the bard can redirect the portal destination to the mouth of any other active portal or breach he has personally traveled through in the past 30 days. Redirection automatically fails if the portal chosen as the temporary endpoint is no longer active. Only creatures and objects are affected by redirection, not traits (which leak through planar breaches). Creatures that enter the portal from the bard''s side of the portal, or creatures that would otherwise arrive at the bard''s location through the portal, instead arrive at the endpoint of another portal chosen by the bard this round. The portal to which the bard redirects travelers continues to connect to its original destination; if a redirected creature attempts to go back through the bard-influenced portal, it doesn''t return to the bard''s location, but instead to that portal''s natural endpoint.

The bard may keep up the dissonance for 10 consecutive rounds (this counts as one of the bard''s bardic music uses per day).

This benefit replaces the suggestion bardic music ability gained by a standard bard at 6th level. If the bard later qualifies for the mass suggestion bardic music ability, he gains the suggestion ability instead.

Planar Discordance (Su): A bard of 12th level or higher with 15 or more ranks in a Perform skill who selects this planar substitution benefit can attempt to create a minor planar breach (as the precipitate breach spell). The bard must perform for 1 full minute, spending a standard action each round to concentrate on the performance.

At the end of the performance, the minor breach comes into existence with an onset time of 1d4 rounds, as indicated by the precipitate breach spell description. If the bard has further uses of his bardic music ability for the day, he may attempt to exacerbate the breach further, as described in the spell description.

This benefit replaces the song of freedom bardic music ability gained by a standard bard at 12th level.

Repel Domination
Your study of the undead allows you to fortify your mind against their attacks.

Level: 6th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the suggestion bardic music ability.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting spells or abilities from undead creatures. Furthermore, whenever you succeed on such a saving throw, the undead creature that produced the effect is shaken for the remainder of the encounter.


Savage Bard
The savage bard is a warrior at heart, though his arcane powers strike fear into the enemies of his tribe. Savage bards often multi-class as barbarians to improve their combat prowess.

Alignment: A savage bard must be chaotic in alignment. A savage bard who becomes nonchaotic cannot progress in levels as a bard, though he retains all his bard abilities.

Base Save Bonuses: A savage bard has good Fortitude and Will saves, but has poor Reflex saves.

Class Skills
A savage bard loses Decipher Script and Speak Language as class skills. He adds Survival to his list of class skills.

Class Features
The savage bard has all the standard bard class features, except as noted below.

Illiteracy: A savage bard is illiterate, just as a barbarian is. An illiterate savage bard cannot use or scribe scrolls.

Spellcasting: Remove the following spells from the savage bard''s class spell list: calm emotions, comprehend languages, detect secret doors, erase, prestidigitation, read magic, sepia snake sigil, summon monster (I through VI).

Add the following spells to the savage bard''s class spell list:�

1st - calm animals, detect snares and pits, endure elements, summon nature''s ally I;�

2nd - bull''s strength, pass without trace, summon nature''s ally II;�

3rd - snare, summon nature''s ally III;�

4th - insect plague, summon nature''s ally IV;�

5th - commune with nature, summon nature''s ally V;�

6th - creeping doom, reincarnate, summon nature''s ally VI.

Spellbreaker Song
Bards pride themselves on being masters of language and sound. A rare few learn to use their voices to interfere with enemy spellcasters, twisting word and sound to defeat spells before they are cast.

Class: Bard.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank, Perform (any) 3 ranks.

Replaces: You do not gain the countersong bardic music ability.

Benefit: You can use your music or poetics to interfere with spells that have verbal components. Doing this costs one daily use of your bardic music ability and requires a standard action to start. Enemy spellcasters within 30 feet of you take a 20% spell failure chance when casting any spell that has a verbal component (as if they were deafened). You can maintain your spellbreaker song for 3 rounds.

This ability follows all the other appropriate rules for bardic music.

Spellscale Bard
Despite their inclination for sorcery, spellscales make excellent bards, exploiting their racial affinity for arcane magic and superior charm. However, knowledge of arcane mysteries remains an important part of a spellscale bard''s abilities.

Class Features
All the following are features of the spellscale bard racial substitution levels.

Draconic Bardic Knowledge (Ex): A spellscale bard has special interest in events, items, and individuals important to dragons. Upon taking the 1st-level racial substitution level, a spellscale bard''s keen interest in dragon lore grants him a +5 competence bonus on any bardic knowledge check related to dragons, so long as he maintains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level.

Inspire Arcana (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a spellscale bard can spend one daily use of bardic music to make a single allied arcane spellcaster more powerful. To use this ability, a spellscale bard must have 3 or more ranks in Perform and a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level. The ally must be within 30 feet of and able to see and hear the spellscale bard, and the bard must be able to see the ally. As long as the chosen arcane spellcaster continues to hear the bard''s performance, she casts her arcane spells with a +1 bonus to her caster level. The effect lasts as long as the spellscale bard concentrates, up to a maximum of 2 minutes. A bard can''t inspire arcana upon himself. Inspire arcana is a mindaffecting ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard bard''s inspire competence class feature.

Superior Suggestion (Sp): A spellscale bard who takes the 6th-level racial substitution level draws on his knowledge of his sorcerous ancestors to enhance his suggestion ability. So long as he maintains a number of ranks in Knowledge (arcana) equal to or greater than his bard class level, a spellscale bard gains a +2 bonus on the save DC whenever he uses his suggestion bardic music ability.

This substitution feature augments the standard bard''s suggestion class feature, and it replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard bard at 6th level. From 6th level on, a spellscale bard who takes this substitution level can cast one less 2nd-level spell per day than shown on Table: The Bard.

Undead Bardic Knowledge
A lightbringer bard has special interest in events, items, and persons that are important to undead. Your focused, careful studies allow you to identify such creatures and effects commonly associated with them.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain bardic knowledge.

Benefit: You can tap into some of your specialized knowledge of the undead. You make a check just as though using the standard bardic knowledge ability, but your insights concern only the undead. You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on this check. You can attempt this check in addition to a Knowledge (religion) check to learn about an undead creature or some other bit of undead lore, such as an item used to destroy a legendary undead or a plague caused by undead.',

The handiwork of the gods is everywhere - in places of natural beauty, in mighty crusades, in soaring temples, and in the hearts of worshipers. Like people, gods run the gamut from benevolent to malicious, reserved to intrusive, simple to inscrutable. The gods, however, work mostly through intermediaries - their clerics. Good clerics heal, protect, and avenge. Evil clerics pillage, destroy, and sabotage. A cleric uses the power of his god to make his god''s will manifest. And if a cleric uses his god''s power to improve his own lot, that''s to be expected, too.

Ideally, a cleric''s adventures support his god''s causes, at least in a general way. A good cleric, for example, helps those in need. If, through noble acts, he can improve the reputation to his god or temple, that''s even better. An evil cleric seeks to increase his own power and that of his deity, so that others will respect and fear both.

Clerics sometimes receive orders, or at least suggestions, from their ecclesiastical superiors, directing them to undertake missions for the church. The clerics and their companions are compensated fairly for these missions, and the church may be especially generous with the casting of needed spells or divine magic items as payment. Of course, clerics are people, too, and they may have any or all the more common motivations for adventuring.

Clerics are masters of divine magic, which is especially good at healing. Even an inexperienced cleric can bring people back from the brink of death, and an experienced cleric can bring back people who have crossed over that brink. As channelers of divine energy, clerics can affect undead creatures. A good cleric can turn away or even destroy undead; an evil cleric can bring undead under his control. Clerics have some combat training. They can use simple weapons, and they are trained in the use of armor, since armor does not interfere with divine spells the way it does with arcane spells.

Alignment: Like the gods they serve, clerics can be of any alignment. Because people more readily worship good deities than neutral or evil ones, there are more good than evil clerics. Clerics also tend toward law instead of chaos, since lawful religions tend to be more structured and better able to recruit and train clerics than chaotic ones.

Typically, a cleric is the same alignment as his deity, though some clerics are one step away from their respective deities in alignment. For example, most clerics of Heironeous, the god of valor (who is lawful good) are lawful good, but some are lawful neutral or neutral good. Additionally, a cleric may not be neutral (that is, neutral on both the good-evil axis and the lawful-chaotic axis) unless his deity is neutral.

Every reasonably well-known deity has clerics devoted to him or her, so clerics can be of any religion. The deity most common worshiped by human clerics in civilized lands is Pelor (god of the sun). The majority of nonhuman clerics are devoted to the chief god of the appropriate racial pantheon. Most clerics are officially ordained members of religious organizations, commonly called churches. Each has sworn to uphold the ideals of his church. Some clerics devote themselves not to a god but to a cause or a source of divine power. These characters wield magic the way clerics devoted to individual gods do, but they are not associated with any religious institution or any particular practice of worship. A cleric devoted to good and law, for example, may be on friendly terms with the clerics of lawful and good deities and may extol the virtues of a good and lawful life, but he is not a functionary in a church hierarchy.

Most clerics join their churches as young adults, though some are devoted to a god''s service from a young age, and a few feel the call later in life. While some clerics are tightly bound to their churches'' activities on a daily basis, others have more freedom to conduct their lives as they please, as long as they do so in accordance with their gods'' wishes.

Clerics of a given religion are all supposed to get along, though schisms within a church are often more bitter than conflicts between religions. Clerics who share some basic ideals, such as goodness or lawfulness, may find common cause with each other and see themselves as part of an order or body that supersedes any given religion. Clerics of opposed goals, however, are sworn enemies. In civilized lands, open warfare between religions occurs only during civil wars and similar social upheavals, but vicious politicking between opposed churches is common.

All the common races are represented in this class, since the need for religion and divine magic is universal. The clerics of most races, however, are too focused on their religious duties to undertake an adventurer''s life. Crusading, adventuring clerics most often come from the human and dwarf races. Among the savage humanoids, clerics are less common. The exception is troglodytes, who take well to divine magic and are often led by priests, who make a practice of sacrificing and devouring captives.

In an adventuring party, the cleric is everybody''s friend and often the glue that holds the party together. As the one who can channel divine energy, a cleric is a capable healer, and adventurers of every class appreciate being put back together after they''ve taken some hard knocks. Clerics sometimes clash with druids, since druids represent an older, more primal relationship between the mortal and the divine. Mostly, though, the religion of a cleric determines how he gets along with others. A cleric of Olidammara (god of thieves), gets along fine with rogues and ne''er-do-wells, for example, while a cleric of Heironeous (god of valor) rankles at such company.

The cleric serves as a typical group''s primary healer, diviner, and defensive specialist. He can hold his own in a fight but usually isn''t well served by charging to the front of combat. The cleric''s domains and spell selection can greatly affect his role as well.

Alignment: A cleric''s alignment must be within one step of his deity''s (that is, it may be one step away on either the lawful-chaotic axis or the good-evil axis, but not both). A cleric may not be neutral unless his deity''s alignment is also neutral.

Hit Die: d8.

The cleric''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge(arcana) (Int), Knowledge(history) (Int), Knowledge(religion) (Int), Knowledge(the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

1 In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 1st- through 9th-level spells, a cleric gets a domain spell for each spell level, starting at 1st. The "+1" in the entries on this table represents that spell. Domain spells are in addition to any bonus spells the cleric may receive for having a high Wisdom score.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the cleric.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Clerics are proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor (light, medium, and heavy), and with shields (except tower shields).

A cleric who chooses the War domain receives the Weapon Focus feat related to his deity''s weapon as a bonus feat. He also receives the appropriate Martial Weapon Proficiency feat as a bonus feat, if the weapon falls into that category.

Aura (Ex): A cleric of a chaotic, evil, good, or lawful deity has a particularly powerful aura corresponding to the deity''s alignment (see the detect evil spell for details). Clerics who don''t worship a specific deity but choose the Chaotic, Evil, Good, or Lawful domain have a similarly powerful aura of the corresponding alignment.

Spells: A cleric casts divine spells, which are drawn from the cleric spell list. However, his alignment may restrict him from casting certain spells opposed to his moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A cleric must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a cleric must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a cleric''s spell is 10 + the spell level + the cleric''s Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a cleric can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Cleric. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. A cleric also gets one domain spell of each spell level he can cast, starting at 1st level. When a cleric prepares a spell in a domain spell slot, it must come from one of his two domains (see Deities, Domains, and Domain Spells, below).

Clerics meditate or pray for their spells. Each cleric must choose a time at which he must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation or supplication to regain his daily allotment of spells. Time spent resting has no effect on whether a cleric can prepare spells. A cleric may prepare and cast any spell on the cleric spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells: A cleric''s deity influences his alignment, what magic he can perform, his values, and how others see him. A cleric chooses two domains from among those belonging to his deity. A cleric can select an alignment domain (Chaos, Evil, Good, or Law) only if his alignment matches that domain.

If a cleric is not devoted to a particular deity, he still selects two domains to represent his spiritual inclinations and abilities. The restriction on alignment domains still applies.

Each domain gives the cleric access to a domain spell at each spell level he can cast, from 1st on up, as well as a granted power. The cleric gets the granted powers of both the domains selected. With access to two domain spells at a given spell level, a cleric prepares one or the other each day in his domain spell slot. If a domain spell is not on the cleric spell list, a cleric can prepare it only in his domain spell slot.

Spontaneous Casting: A good cleric (or a neutral cleric of a good deity) can channel stored spell energy into healing spells that the cleric did not prepare ahead of time. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell that is not a domain spell in order to cast any cure spell of the same spell level or lower (a cure spell is any spell with "cure" in its name).

An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric of an evil deity), can''t convert prepared spells to cure spells but can convert them to inflict spells (an inflict spell is one with "inflict" in its name).

A cleric who is neither good nor evil and whose deity is neither good nor evil can convert spells to either cure spells or inflict spells (player''s choice). Once the player makes this choice, it cannot be reversed. This choice also determines whether the cleric turns or commands undead (see below).

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: A cleric can''t cast spells of an alignment opposed to his own or his deity''s (if he has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

Turn or Rebuke Undead (Su): Any cleric, regardless of alignment, has the power to affect undead creatures by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol (see Turn or Rebuke Undead).

A good cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships a good deity) can turn or destroy undead creatures. An evil cleric (or a neutral cleric who worships an evil deity) instead rebukes or commands such creatures. A neutral cleric of a neutral deity must choose whether his turning ability functions as that of a good cleric or an evil cleric. Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. This decision also determines whether the cleric can cast spontaneous cure or inflict spells (see above).

A cleric may attempt to turn undead a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. A cleric with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion) gets a +2 bonus on turning checks against undead.

Bonus Languages: A cleric''s bonus language options include Celestial, Abyssal, and Infernal (the languages of good, chaotic evil, and lawful evil outsiders, respectively). These choices are in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

Ex-Clerics
A cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his god loses all spells and class features, except for armor and shield proficiencies and proficiency with simple weapons. He cannot thereafter gain levels as a cleric of that god until he atones (see the atonement spell description).

Ancestral Speaker
Many cultures, both primitive and surprisingly advanced, give their religious devotion not to deities (or at least not solely to deities), but to the spirits of their departed ancestors. An ancestral speaker calls upon his forebears, and the deceased patriarchs and matriarchs of his clan, family, or nation, for spells and guidance. Unlike standard clerics, whose first devotion is often to their priesthood, an ancestral speaker serves and protects the honor of his ancestors and the well-being of his people with equal fervor. They are, after all, essentially the same thing; his people today are the family of those who have gone, and they themselves will one day be the ancestor spirits to following generations.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The ancestral speaker''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int). Further, an ancestral speaker may choose any two cross-class skills to become class skills; these were taught to him by his ancestors during communion over the course of his training to become an ancestral speaker.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the ancestral speaker.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The ancestral speaker is proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Ancestral Communion (Ex): In addition to spells, the ancestral speaker may pray to his ancestors for advice or knowledge. At 1st level, the ancestral speaker may request a bonus on any one specific skill, once per day. The ancestors grant him temporary knowledge of that skill, bestowing a competence bonus equal to the ancestral speaker''s Charisma modifier plus his class level. It does not matter if the speaker already possesses any ranks in this skill or not; the ancestral speaker can use the skill even if he is untrained in its use or cannot normally use it. The bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1 plus the ancestral speaker''s Charisma bonus. At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the ancestral speaker may use this power an additional time per day.

At 9th level, the ancestral speaker may choose to ask the ancestors'' advice, rather than seeking their aid with skills. Instead of a skill bonus, he may choose to ask them questions, as per the commune spell cast by a cleric of his level. He may do this only once per day; any other uses of ancestral communion during that day must be requests for help with a skill.

Holy Presence (Ex): The ancestral speaker is considered to be his own holy symbol, as he is descended from the beings on whom he calls. Thus, he need not carry any such symbol, and can cast spells with the Divine Focus component without one.

Death Talker (Ex): Due to his long association with the spirits of the departed, the 4th-level ancestral speaker gains a +2 bonus to all Diplomacy, Bluff, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against undead. At 8th level and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2.

Improved Resurrection (Ex): The ancestors on whom the speaker calls well know the pathways between life and death, and they can smooth over the transition for anyone making the crossing at their speaker''s behest. Anyone raised or resurrected by an ancestral speaker still loses a level, but only a portion of the normal XP. Under most conditions, level loss drops the victim to the halfway point of the old level; someone raised by an ancestral speaker drops to the three-quarter mark. For example, a 9th-level character who is raised would normally drop to 32,000 XP. (A character needs 28,000 for 8th level and 36,000 for 9th, so half the difference is 4,000.) If that character was raised by a speaker, however, he would drop only to 34,000 XP.

Arcane Disciple
Many worlds have gods of magic and clerics who worship them. Some clerics, however, give their devotion not to any deity of magic but to the concept and forces of magic itself. They believe that magic represents the fundamental power underlying all reality and worship it as a force higher than any god. These arcane disciples believe that all magic is inherently linked, although they have only managed to cross the boundary between arcane and divine in minor fashion. Many arcane disciples multiclass as wizards and go on to obtain the mystic theurge prestige class.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Skills
The arcane disciple''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Use Magic Device (Cha).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the arcane disciple.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The arcane disciple is proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Arcane to Divine (Ex): At every level, the arcane disciple may choose one arcane spell from either the bard or sorcerer/wizard spell list. This spell must be at least one level lower than the highest-level divine spell the character may cast. The arcane disciple may then add this spell to her normal clerical spell list, and forever after may cast it as a divine spell like any other. Furthermore, while the arcane disciple does not technically possess the Magic domain (as she has no domains to choose from), all the spells of the Magic domain are considered divine spells for the arcane disciple, and are added to her cleric spell list in addition to any arcane spells she chooses as she advances in level.

Bonus Feats: At 1st level, at 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, the arcane disciple gains a bonus feat. These feats must be either metamagic or item creation feats.

Aspirant
Among some religious orders, the goal of the initiates is not to serve the gods but to become like them. Some cultures believe divine ascension is possible - that mortals can rise to take a seat beside the gods themselves. Others maintain that mortals cannot become divinities but that they might yet serve the gods on a higher plane as saints or proxies. Still others believe that even if they never achieve true ascension through their endeavors, their efforts to imitate the divine raise them above their fellow mortals.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The aspirant''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modifier) × 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the aspirant.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The aspirant is proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Spontaneous Casting: At 1st level, the aspirant gains the ability to lose any prepared clerical spell for any other clerical spell of equal or lower level, but only once per day. She may cast a spontaneous spell twice per day at 4th level, three times per day at 8th, four times per day at 12th, and five times per day at 16th level. This represents the aspirant''s growing ability to manipulate divine energies directly.

Shield of the Divine (Ex): At 1st level, the aspirant gains a +1 bonus to AC. At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, the bonus increases by +1. This bonus applies even when the aspirant is flat-footed or helpless.

Divine Counterspell (Sp): An aspirant of 3rd-level or higher may counter a divine spell cast by another spellcaster without expending a spell for the day. The aspirant must be high enough level to cast a spell of the same level as the spell she wishes to counter. To do so, an aspirant must ready an action to counterspell as normal, but the aspirant need not determine what the spell is. If the spell cast is not a divine spell, the aspirant cannot counter it, but she does not waste her use of this ability, only her action. The aspirant can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Perfect Self: At 20th level, the aspirant has become so fully connected with the power of the divine that she becomes a magical creature. This ability has the same effect as the monk ability of the same name.


Azurin Cleric
An azurin cleric dedicates herself not only to a deity or pantheon, but also to the power of incarnum. Just as most azurins cleave to polarized alignments, azurin clerics take extreme positions on morals and ethics. Azurin clerics prefer to battle foes opposed to their alignment, and work best with other incarnum-wielding characters.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take an azurin cleric substitution level, a character must be an azurin about to take her 1st, 4th, or 9th level of cleric.

Class Skills
Azurin cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard cleric class, plus Knowledge (the planes).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All of the following are features of the azurin cleric racial substitution levels.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: An azurin cleric who selects any azurin cleric substitution level loses the ability to cast any spells of an alignment that doesn''t match her own. For example, a chaotic good azurin cleric can''t cast evil or lawful spells.

This restriction replaces the standard cleric restriction regarding what alignment of spells the cleric can cast.

Channel Incarnum (Su): An azurin cleric channels incarnum rather than mere positive or negative energy. Once per round as a free action, an azurin cleric can grant herself bonus essentia equal to her Charisma bonus or one-half her cleric level (whichever is lower), minimum 1. This essentia lasts for 1 round.

The character can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces a standard cleric''s ability to turn or rebuke undead gained at 1st level. An azurin cleric can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead to qualify for any divine feat, and can spend daily uses of this feat to power divine feats as if they were daily uses of turn or rebuke undead (though doing so requires a standard action rather than a free action unless the feat states otherwise).

Soultouched Weapon (Su): Beginning at 4th level, an azurin cleric can use incarnum to imbue her weapon with the power of her soul''s convictions. This requires a move action and grants a single held melee weapon an alignment for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The alignment chosen must be part of the azurin cleric''s alignment; for example, a chaotic good azurin cleric could choose to make her weapon chaotic or good, but not lawful or evil. A neutral azurin cleric gains no benefit from this class feature.

While this ability is in effect, an azurin cleric can also invest essentia in the affected weapon. The weapon gains an insight bonus equal to the invested essentia on damage rolls against creatures whose alignment includes a component opposed to the chosen alignment. For example, a good weapon would deal an extra 1 point of damage per point of invested essentia against evil creatures (whether lawful evil, neutral evil, or chaotic evil).

The effects of this ability last for a number of rounds equal to 3 + one-half her class level. An azurin cleric can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From this point forward, the number of 2nd-level spell slots possessed by an azurin cleric is reduced by one.

Distribute Incarnum (Su): A 9th-level azurin cleric can enhance the essentia pools of nearby allies by distributing free-flowing incarnum in the environment. This requires the cleric to sacrifice a cleric spell of 5th level or higher (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) and grants all allies (including herself) within 30 feet bonus essentia equal to the spell''s level. All affected characters can immediately invest this essentia without spending an action (though currently invested essentia may not be shifted). The essentia lasts until the end of the cleric''s next turn.

If an ally has no essentia pool, she can instead choose to heal 1 hp of damage per point of essentia that would be granted. This applies equally to all living and undead creatures, regardless of whether the cleric would normally spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells.

This benefit replaces a standard cleric''s ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells of 5th level and above.

Benevolent
In many cultures, the primary function of the cleric is to bless the undertakings of others, to grant the gods'' favor on those who labor in their name. The benevolent exemplifies this role. A benevolent is devoted to aiding and abetting others in their times of need and to increasing the good fortune of his allies. The benevolent is as capable in combat as any cleric - otherwise he could not accompany soldiers on the battlefield - but his focus is on their needs, not his own. The vast majority of benevolents are good-aligned, although evil ones are not unheard of.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The benevolent''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the benevolent.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The benevolent is proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (including tower shields).

Spontaneous Casting (Ex): The benevolent has a wider range of spontaneous spells than the standard cleric, although they are all geared toward aiding others. The benevolent may lose any prepared spell of equal or higher level in exchange for any of the following spells:

0 - cure minor wounds, guidance, resistance;

1st - bless, cure light wounds, sanctuary;

2nd - aid, cure moderate wounds, shield other;

3rd - cure serious wounds, prayer, remove curse;

4th - cure critical wounds, restoration, spell immunity;

5th - atonement, mass cure light wounds;

6th - mass cure moderate wounds, heal;

7th - greater restoration, mass cure serious wounds;

8th - mass cure critical wounds;

9th - mass heal.

Luck of the Gods (Sp): Starting at 4th level, the benevolent can, with a brief benediction, bestow good fortune upon others. The recipient of this prayer may, any time within the next 24 hours, reroll any single die roll, as per the granted power for the Luck Domain. If the blessing is not used within 24 hours, it is lost. Additionally, the recipient may add a luck bonus equal to the benevolent''s Charisma bonus to any single roll during that 24-hour period. These two effects can be applied to the same roll. The benevolent may not use this power on himself, and he may use it only upon someone within one alignment step of his deity. Multiple applications of luck of the gods do not stack. This power may be used once per day at 4th level, twice per day at 8th level, three times per day at 12th level, four times per day at 16th level, and five times per day at 20th level.

Blasphemous Incantation
Not all evil deities or fiendish powers are concerned with undead. Some grant their mortal servants the ability to channel their unholy will in the form of a blasphemous incantation.

Class: Cleric.

Level: 1st (cleric).

Special Requirement: To select this class feature, you must be evil. If your alignment changes to something other than evil, you lose access to this class feature until your alignment is restored to evil.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you lose the ability to rebuke undead.

Benefit: You can call upon your evil master to smite your enemies. All good creatures within 30 feet must succeed on Fortitude saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your caster level + your Cha modifier) or become sickened for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round).

You can utter a blasphemous incantation a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Cha modifier. If you have 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (religion), the DC of the Fortitude save increases by 2.

Blasphemous incantation is a supernatural ability.

Champion
Some clerics prefer to be champions of good (or evil), standing at the forefront of the battle against the enemy.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Turn undead.

Gain: Smite evil, if the cleric would normally channel positive energy, or smite good, if the cleric would normally channel negative energy (as paladin); aura of courage (as paladin).

Cloistered Cleric
The cloistered cleric spends more time than other clerics in study and prayer and less in martial training. He gives up some of the cleric''s combat prowess in exchange for greater skill access and a wider range of spells devoted to knowledge (and the protection of knowledge).

Most cloistered clerics are nonchaotic, since they believe that a disciplined lifestyle lends itself better to learning.

Hit Die: The cloistered cleric uses a d6 for his Hit Die (and has hit points at 1st level equal to 6 + Con modifier).

Base Attack Bonus: The cloistered cleric''s lack of martial training means that he uses the poor base attack bonus.

Class Skills
The cloistered cleric''s class skill list includes Decipher Script, Speak Language, and all Knowledge skills (from the Knowledge domain, see below). The cloistered cleric gains skill points per level equal to 6 + Int modifier (and has this number × 4 at 1st level).

Class Features
The cloistered cleric has all the standard cleric class features, except as noted below.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Cloistered clerics are proficient with simple weapons and with light armor.

Lore (Ex): Thanks to long hours of study, a cloistered cleric has a wide range of stray knowledge. This ability is identical to the bard''s bardic knowledge class feature, using the cloistered cleric''s class level in place of the bard level.

Deity, Domains, and Domain Spells: Most cloistered clerics worship deities associated with knowledge and learning.

In addition to any domains selected from his deity''s list, a cloistered cleric automatically gains the Knowledge domain as a bonus domain (even if the Knowledge domain is not normally available to clerics of that deity). He gains the Knowledge domain granted power and may select his bonus domain spell from the Knowledge domain or from one of his two regular domains.

Spellcasting: Add the following spells to the cloistered cleric''s class spell list:

0 - message;

1st - erase, identify, unseen servant;

2nd - fox''s cunning;

3rd - illusory script, secret page, tongues (reduced from 4th level);

4th - detect scrying;

6th - analyze dweomer;

7th - sequester;

9th - vision.

Crusader
The crusader is a holy warrior, a martial priest dedicated to battling the enemies of his church and spreading the teachings of his deity throughout the lands. The crusader is in many respects akin to the paladin, but is devoted solely to ridding the world of the followers of enemy gods, rather than the paladin''s code. She wields weapon and spell with equal faculty, and is willing either to lead others into battle or to stand against the enemy alone.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The crusader''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Ride, (Dex), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) × 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the crusader.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The crusader is proficient with all simple weapons, with all types of armor, and with shields (including tower shields). In addition, the crusader may choose a single martial weapon with which she is proficient, as though she had the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat.

Deific Foe (Ex): At 1st level and every 5 levels thereafter, a crusader must choose a deity opposed to her own god. The crusader gains a +4 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls against worshipers of the chosen deific foe.

Turn Foe''s Followers (Su): Starting at ist level, the crusader may turn or destroy worshipers of her deific foe. This is resolved just like a normal cleric''s turn undead ability, except that the ability only affects worshipers of the deific foe. A crusader can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. A crusader with 5 or more ranks of Knowledge (religion) gains a +2 bonus on turning checks against worshipers of her deific foe.

Bonus Feats: The crusader gains a bonus feat at 3rd level and every five levels thereafter. These feats must come from the fighter''s bonus feat list, with the following alteration: Remove Weapon Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization from the list (as clerics cannot take those feats), and replace it with Combat Casting.

Smite (Su): Once per day, beginning at 5th level, a crusader may make a smite attack against any foe, so long as the foe does not worship the crusader''s deity and does not share either the deity''s or the crusader''s alignment. She adds her Charisma bonus to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per crusader level. If the crusader accidentally smites a creature that does not qualify by the above conditions, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for the day. At 10th, 15th, and 20th level the crusader gains an additional smite attempt per day.

Dead Levels
The cleric has nineteen dead levels, but this is mitigated by their one and only special ability: turn or rebuke undead. The turning damage for this ability steadily increases every level (2d6 + the cleric''s level + the cleric''s Charisma modifier). Still, a prestige class that grants +1 level of divine spellcasting, normal turn or rebuke undead advancement, and special abilities at every level opens the door for a minor dead level ability.

Undead Intuition (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a cleric can identify undead creatures during an encounter from any distance. The cleric gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks to identify undead creatures, but gains no insight about their special powers or vulnerabilities. See the Knowledge skill description. Moreover, the cleric can make these Knowledge (undead) checks untrained. This bonus increases by +1 for each cleric level the character takes after 2nd level.


Destroy Undead
You can channel positive energy to destroy undead creatures.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn undead.

Benefit: Instead of the cleric''s normal ability to turn or rebuke undead, a lightbringer cleric can channel positive energy to destroy undead. Thus, a lightbringer cleric contributes to the destruction of undead in a fashion that interacts well with the other characters in the party such as the fighter and wizard. Lightbringer clerics want to destroy undead; thus, they despise seeing turned undead run away never seen again. At other times, a standard turning effect has no effect whatsoever, much to the chagrin of the lightbringer cleric.

Destroying undead is a standard action that deals 1d6 points of damage per cleric level to all undead within 30 feet of the cleric. The affected undead get a Will save (DC 10 + cleric level + Cha modifier) for half damage. Undead with turn resistance can subtract that number from the damage that they take from each turn attempt. For example, a vampire with turn resistance +4 takes 4 fewer points of damage each time he takes turning damage.

When using this ability against incorporeal creatures, the lightbringer cleric does not have to roll a 50% miss chance; turning hits them automatically.
Destroy undead still counts as turn undead for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for feats, prestige classes, and so forth. A lightbringer cleric can use this ability the same number of times per day that he could turn undead. If a feat requires the expenditure of one or more uses of turn undead, it instead consumes uses of this ability. Any ability that grants a bonus to turning checks instead grants an equal bonus to this ability''s save DC. This is a supernatural ability.

Divine Counterspell
Although the ability to turn undead is arguably a defining cleric characteristic, some clerics (and paladins) find that they can be even more effective crusaders by opposing evil spellcasters. The ability to negate an enemy spellcasters magic grants a character an unexpected edge.

Class: Cleric or paladin.

Level: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain the supernatural ability to counter another spellcaster''s magic through pure force of will. This ability functions just as if you were using dispel magic to counter the spell, except that you add your cleric level (instead of your caster level) to the d20 roll. You don''t need to identify the spell the opposing spellcaster is casting to make the attempt.

If you don''t have a cleric level, use your effective cleric level for the purpose of turning undead. For example, a paladin would normally turn undead as a cleric of three levels lower; her effective cleric level for counterspelling is equal to her paladin level - 3.

You can attempt to counterspell a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Cha modifier.

A character with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana) gets a +2 bonus on counterspelling attempts when using this ability.

Divine Magician
Deities influence the world through the divine spells they grant their worshipers. Some clerics, however, choose to explore magical powers beyond those commonly provided by the gods. By giving up some of their divine power, these clerics gain access to spells normally beyond their abilities.

This class feature can be chosen only once.

Class: Cleric.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You gain only one domain (including spells and granted power) at 1st level, rather than two.

Benefit: You can add one 1st-level abjuration, divination, or necromancy wizard spell to your cleric spell list. Each time you gain the ability to cast a new level of cleric spells, you can add a single wizard spell of the same level from one of those schools to your cleric spell list.

Divine Restoration
When you or your teammates lose your strength in the middle of a dungeon, you can''t always "call it a day" and rest. You can restore the party''s hit points by trading spells for healing magic, but other setbacks besides physical injury might impede your progress: insidious disease, vermin poison, or noxious fumes. By focusing your divine purpose, you can restore your party''s lost abilities.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you sacrifice one of your domain granted powers.

Benefit: At 3rd level, select one of your chosen cleric domains. You can still select and cast spells from that domain list, but you no longer can use the domain''s granted power. Instead, you gain the ability to spontaneously cast lesser restoration, restoration, or greater restoration by sacrificing a prepared spell of the same level.

For example, Jozan is 3rd level and selects this alternate class feature. He had chosen the Healing and Protection domains at 1st level. He gives up the Healing domain granted power. He no longer casts healing spells at +1 caster level, but he can sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell to spontaneously cast lesser restoration. At 7th level, he''ll be able to sacrifice a 4th-level spell to cast restoration, and at 13th level, a 7th-level spell to cast greater restoration.

Special: When spontaneously casting a restoration spell, you must still expend the required components.

Domain Focus
Clerics lose their way the most easily, especially at lower levels. Even more experienced clerics sometimes become shaken by unexpected tragedies. When a cleric loses his way and sees only the "pure" version of his deity, he focuses on a single aspect of his deity to the exclusion of all others.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you lose the ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into cure or inflict spells. You also lose access to one of your domains and all spells on that domain spell list are permanently removed from all your spell lists.

Benefit: You gain many of the benefits of your remaining domain as if you had taken it twice.

You gain double the benefit from your remaining domain''s granted power, if applicable. If your remaining domain granted power has a limited number of uses per day, you may use the domain granted power twice as many times per day; if your remaining domain granted power offers a bonus, the bonus is doubled. If your remaining domain granted power has limited uses and also grants a bonus (such as the granted power of the Destruction domain), you must choose which to double: the number of times per day you can use it or double the bonus; you do not gain both. The number of uses per day that doubles dots not count additional uses based on ability scores. For example, domain granted powers that grant you the ability to turn or rebuke elemental creatures grant you that ability a number of times per day equal to 6 + your Charisma modifier, and not 6 + double your Charisma modifier.

Dragonblood Cleric
Dragonblood creatures are naturally inclined toward arcane magic. Some hear the call of a deity, however, and become clerics instead. Dragonblood clerics focus on the elemental affinities of their draconic bloodline.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a dragonblood cleric substitution level, a character must have the dragonblood subtype and be about to take her 1st, 5th, or 9th level of cleric.

Class Skills
Dragonblood cleric substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the dragonblood cleric racial substitution levels.

Notes: The following substitution level class features require the dragonblood cleric to select one energy type from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic. The energy type must be the same for all these substitution features.

A half-dragon who takes one or more of these substitution levels must choose the energy type that matches her breath weapon (if possible). If a half-dragon cleric''s breath weapon doesn''t have an energy type, she can choose any energy type so long as it is the same for all substitution level class features.

A dragonblood cleric who doesn''t take the 1st-level racial substitution level can expend turn undead uses in place of turn energy uses if she takes the 5th- or 9th-level racial substitution levels.

Turn Energy (Su): Starting at 1st level, a dragonblood cleric can channel the elemental power of dragons to grant her and her allies protection from energy a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The cleric and all allies within 30 feet gain temporary immunity to the specified energy type. Each protected ally remains immune until the effect protects him from 5 points of energy damage per cleric level, after which the effect is discharged for that ally. If it is not discharged, the benefit of the effect fades after 1 minute per cleric level. The cleric can exclude herself and any allies she chooses from the effect.

Turn energy overlaps and does not stack with the effect of the resist energy spell. If a character is warded by both this effect and resist energy, this effect absorbs damage until it is discharged. Turn energy stacks with the effect of the protection from energy spell.

This substitution level class feature replaces the standard cleric''s turn or rebuke undead class feature. For a dragonblood cleric, turn energy counts as turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of meeting prerequisites for feats, prestige classes, and so on.

Energy Barrier (Su): A dragonblood cleric who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to create a wall of energy. This ability functions like the benefit of the Exhaled Barrier feat, except as noted below.

Any creature passing through the wall takes 1d6 points of energy damage per two cleric levels the dragonblood cleric possesses. If the cleric creates the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. Either way, a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the cleric''s class level + her Con modifier) halves this damage.

This substitution feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 5th level. From 5th level on, a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can prepare one less 3rd-level spell per day than shown on Table: The Cleric.

Energy Sustenance (Su): A dragonblood cleric who takes the 9th-level racial substitution level can expend one of her turn energy (or turn undead) uses for the day to gain the benefit of energy sustenance. The energy type selected for this ability can now heal the cleric.

To use energy sustenance, the cleric expends a turn energy use as an immediate action when she is subjected to an attack that deals energy damage of the specified type. If she does so, she heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the cleric to exceed her full normal hit points, she gains any excess as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour. When a dragonblood cleric uses this ability, she willingly fails any saving throw against the incoming energy effect.

This substitution feature replaces the 5th-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 9th level. From 9th level on, a dragonblood cleric who takes this substitution level can prepare one less 5th-level spell per day than shown on Table: The Cleric.

Dragonscale Husk
Any warrior knows that skill in battle isn''t enough; you must also guard against the attacks of your enemies. A well-forged suit of armor can mean the difference between life and death, but a warrior whose very body is his armor has an immediate advantage. Those who have the blood of dragons running in their veins can gain this benefit.

Class: Any standard class that grants proficiency in heavy armor, such as fighter or paladin.

Level: 1st (unless the class grants proficiency in heavy armor at a level other than 1st, in which case this feature can be taken only at that level).

Special Requirement: You must be of the dragonblood subtype to select this alternative class feature. As long as you gain the dragonblood subtype at the same level that you would gain heavy armor proficiency, you can select this class feature, even if you would normally choose class features before selecting the option that grants you the subtype. For example, a 1st-level human fighter who takes Dragontouched as one of his 1st-level feats could also select this class feature.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain proficiency with any kind of armor. If you would later gain some form of armor proficiency (such as by multiclassing or taking a feat), you can choose at that time to gain that profi ciency, but you then lose this class feature. If you already have proficiency with any kind of armor, you must lose that proficiency in order to select this class feature.

Benefit: You gain the extraordinary ability to grow a thick, scaly hide that protects you like armor. The dragonscale husk resembles the scales of a dragon of your choice (selected when you gain the class feature). The husk requires 8 hours to grow, but this process can take place at night while you are sleeping.

Your scaled hide grants you a bonus to your Armor Class equal to 6 + 1/3 your class level in the class that granted you heavy armor proficiency (+7 bonus to AC at 3rd level, +8 bonus to AC at 6th level, and so on, up to a maximum +12 bonus to AC at 18th level). Multiple classes that grant this proficiency stack for determining the dragonscale husk''s total bonus. This bonus doesn''t stack with any feat, racial trait, or other special ability that would grant you a bonus to Armor Class.

In addition, as you attain higher levels, your husk grants you increasing resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. You gain resistance 5 at 5th level, resistance 10 at 10th level, resistance 15 at 15th level, and resistance 20 at 20th level.

Your dragonscale husk is treated as medium armor for the purpose of determining your speed and whether you can use class features or other special abilities. It allows a maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class of +2 and has an armor check penalty of -4. You can sleep in your husk without penalty. You cannot wear any other armor while your husk is present.

Your husk isn''t treated as armor for the purpose of being affected by spells or other abilities. You can''t grant it an enhancement bonus with magic vestment, nor can you imbue it with special properties, as you could a normal suit of armor.

You can''t take off your dragonscale husk, but you can choose to shed it. Doing this requires 10 minutes of concentration and results in your sloughing off a pile of scales that crumble to dust if handled.

Drow Cleric
Everything you do, everything you are, is devoted heart and soul to Lolth: to spreading her power across the Underdark, and, of course, to cementing your own base of power among the drow. How better to honor the Weaver of Webs, after all, than to ensure that so potent and loyal a servant as yourself can direct her minions?

Master of Spiders
Spiders - the favored of Lolth and the totems of your race - respond to your call, bowing before you as they do before the divine mistress you both serve.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard cleric''s ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You can rebuke or command vermin as an evil cleric rebukes or commands undead. When commanding spiders, you gain a +4 bonus to your effective turning level.

This ability otherwise works exactly as rebuke undead. You can use this ability in place of turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for divine feats.

Dwarf Cleric
The dwarf cleric dedicates herself to her clan and the forge. She takes an active role in defending her people, often serving on the front lines of a battle. In exchange for greater martial ability and power when casting spells of the earth, the cleric gives up her ability to turn or rebuke undead and some of her spellcasting prowess.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a dwarf cleric substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of cleric.

Class Skills
Dwarf cleric substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class plus Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

8th	+6/+1	+6	+2	+6	Earthen spell power	See text
Class Features
All the following are features of the dwarf cleric''s racial substitution levels.

Smite Giants (Su): A dwarf cleric who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can attempt to smite a giant with a melee attack, similar to the way a paladin smites an evil creature. She adds her Constitution bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per cleric level. The cleric can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Con modifier (minimum once per day). If the cleric accidentally smites a creature that is not a giant, the smite has no effect but still counts as one of the cleric''s daily smite attempts.

This substitution benefit replaces the standard cleric''s ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Hammer Specialist (Ex): A dwarf cleric''s dedication to the forge-god results in exceptional skill with the warhammer. A dwarf cleric who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the Martial Weapon Proficiency (warhammer) feat (if she doesn''t already have it). She also gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when wielding a warhammer in melee.

This racial substitution level is only available to dwarf clerics who follow Moradin (or any other deity whose favored weapon is a warhammer).

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 2nd-level cleric spell than indicated on Table: The Cleric.

Earthen Spell Power (Ex): A dwarf cleric who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level draws power from the earth when casting certain spells. When she is in contact with the ground, the cleric''s effective caster level when casting spells with the earth descriptor (or any spell from the Earth domain, such as stoneskin) increases by one. This increase applies when determining level-dependent spell variables and on caster level checks. This increase stacks with other spell power abilities, such as from the hierophant prestige class.

This benefit replaces the 4th-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 8th level. From now on, the cleric can prepare one fewer 4th-level cleric spell than indicated on Table: The Cleric.

Evangelist
Variably respected, scorned, or feared by other clerics, the evangelist has an intensely personal relationship with his deity. He has little if any formal training, and did not necessarily set out to serve a god; instead, his link with his deity developed naturally, not unlike a sorcerer''s spellcasting ability. Evangelists have a narrower range of spells than a cleric, but they are capable of casting their spells spontaneously, with no need for advance preparation.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The evangelist''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (local) (lnt), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) × 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + int modifier.

1 Numbers after the "+" symbol refer to the domain spells added to the evangelist''s spells known list.
Class Features
All of the following are class features of the evangelist.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The evangelist is proficient with all simple weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Evangelist Spellcasting: The evangelist casts divine spells from the cleric spell list. His spellcasting ability is based on his Wisdom score. The evangelist casts these divine spells and gains spells known from the cleric list as a sorcerer casts arcane spells and gains spells from the sorcerer/wizard list. See the "Spells" ability of the sorcerer class for details. Note that the evangelist cannot learn a new divine spell in place of domain spells known.

Domains: At 1st level, the evangelist chooses two domains. He gains the granted ability of both domains, and he adds all the spells listed on the domain spell list to his spells known list at the appropriate levels (although he still can''t cast these spells unless he is of appropriate level). The evangelist does not gain the cleric''s ability to cast extra spells chosen from the domain lists.

Golarion Cleric
Some clerics think of themselves more as holy warriors than proselytizers or shepherds. For these clerics, the ability to fight trumps all other concerns. Taking the above ability requires a cleric to give up both of her domains, including her domain powers.

Holy Warrior (Ex): A cleric with this ability is proficient with her deity''s favored weapon. In addition, her base attack bonus as a cleric equals her cleric level, and her cleric Hit Die becomes a d10.

Improved Domain Powers
Clerics differ immensely in mission, role, and outlook depending on the deities they worship. No one would ever mistake a blood-soaked zealot of Erythnul the Many for a staid healer of Pelor the Burning Hate, for example. Cleric domains reinforce this notion, granting a wide range of specialized abilities and unique spells depending on a cleric''s specific field of expertise.

Sometimes, even these specialized powers are not enough to truly define the differences in faith. A vicious cleric of Hextor and a valiant cleric of Heironeous might both share the exact same domains of Law and War, for example. The following rules present new powers attached to the core domains presented in the Player''s Handbook. Many of these alternative powers go above and beyond the standard domain abilities and, as such, require the cleric to forego other abilities or take a feat.

Attaining Improved Powers
The simplest way a cleric can gain access to the additional powers of his domains is through the selection of the Improved Power feat. While other options exist, the DM must decide which possibilities he allows in his campaign and may add additional requirements as well, such as a sacred quest or special ritual. Some DMs might even choose to make these improved powers a boon granted to clerics who reach a certain level. While the feat and magic item options allow these new powers to be incorporated into an existing campaign, the other options are best if presented to characters at the start of a campaign.

Feat: The ability to use one of the improved powers represents deep devotion and time spent learning about one aspect of a deity. In this case, gaining access to an improved power is best represented by the Improved Power feat. Clerics who take this feat retain both of their granted domain abilities and choose domain spells normally.

IMPROVED POWER [GENERAL]
Chose one of your domains. Through your long devotion and hours of study, you have unlocked one of the improved granted powers of that domain.

Prerequisites: Granted power of the same domain as the selected improved granted power.

Benefit: You may use the improved granted power of the chosen domain.

Special: You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new domain.


Magic Item: Temples have long known the secret of forging special holy symbols that enhance the tie between a cleric and his deity. These rare and valuable magic items bestow the improved granted power while worn (see Devoted Symbol below). Clerics who wear one of these symbols retain both of their granted domain abilities and chose domain spells normally.

DEVOTED SYMBOL
These rare holy symbols enhance the bond between a cleric and his deity, granting access to one improved granted power. Devoted symbols are tied to one specific domain and only grant the power if the wearer already has that domain and is a follower of the same deity. A devoted symbol of Vecna tied to the Knowledge domain only grants the divine inspiration ability if the wearer is a cleric of Vecna with the Knowledge domain. Devoted symbols are worn around the neck, taking up the amulet slot, and can be used as a holy symbol for the purposes of turning or rebuking undead and as a spell focus.

Moderate divination; CL 7th; Craft Wondrous Item, divination; Price 20,000 gp; Weight 1/2 lb.


No Turning: Some clerics never give a second thought to undead, as such monsters are outside the ethos of their figths. These clerics might wish for alternative uses for channeled divine energy. Instead of turning or rebuking undead, these clerics gain one of the improved powers associated with their chosen domains. They still gain both of the standard granted powers and may choose domain spells from either list as normal. The choice to use this option must be made when the first level of cleric is taken. The ability to turn or rebuke undead from other classes is not affected by this choice.

Paladins may elect to use this option as well, but must wait until 4th level to gain an improved power. As with turning undead, a paladin''s effective level for these powers is that of a cleric three levels lower. A paladin must chose one of the domains associated with her deity, and if she has cleric levels the improved power must be from one of her chosen domains. A paladin with cleric levels cannot gain both improved powers through sacrificing the ability to turn undead from both classes. The choice to use this option must be made when the fourth level of paladin is taken.

One Power: Some clerics focus so heavily on one aspect of their deity that they develop powers beyond those of their brethren. Instead of gaining two granted domain powers, these clerics choose one domain and gain the improved granted power instead of either of the standard granted powers. When choosing domain spells, these clerics may choose from both domains as normal. The choice to use this option must be made when the first level of cleric is taken.

Improved powers
The following powers represent all of the domains present in the Player''s Handbook. Other powers are certainly possible for domains from other sources. Unless otherwise noted, activating an improved granted power is a standard action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

AIR
Far-Reaching Wind (Su): The touch of your holy symbol imbues a weapon with the essence of air. Air-imbued weapons are guided to their targets by gusts of wind, allowing supernatural accuracy over long distances. While under this effect, ranged weapons have their range increments doubled, and melee weapons may be hurled as thrown weapons with a range increment of 20 feet. Weapons enhanced in this way maintain their increased range for 1 minute. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

ANIMAL
Totemic Spirit Companion (Sp): You can call upon the spirits of the natural world to aid you as a full-round action. This functions just like the spell summon nature''s ally I using your cleric level as the caster level. All creatures summoned in this way have either the celestial or fiendish template as appropriate to the type of energy you channel. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1). Additional uses of this ability may be expended to summon more powerful creatures, with each additional use spent increasing the spell to the next highest level. For example, a 6th-level cleric could use this ability to cast summon nature''s ally I three times per day or summon nature''s ally III once per day (or any other combination).

CHAOS
Chaos Curse (Su): A forking beam of multicolored light springs from your outstretched finger and strikes an enemy within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. If your target fails a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier), it becomes stricken with random misfortune for 1 minute. Each round, the target has a 50% chance to drop what it is holding (if holding anything) or to provoke an attack of opportunity (if threatened and not holding anything). If neither condition applies, it falls prone. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

DEATH
Call of the Grave (Su): Creatures near you feel the inevitability of death and resist attempts to keep them among the living. When activated, all conjuration spells of the healing subschool cast within 30 feet of you heal half as much damage as normal. In addition, spells that restore life, such as raise dead, reincarnate, and resurrection do not function when cast within 30 feet of you. You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess. These rounds need not be consecutive.

DESTRUCTION
Shattering Blow (Su): You may, as a free action, infuse your attacks with the destructive force of entropy for 1 round. While under this effect, your natural attacks and all weapons you use in melee are treated as adamantine for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction and object hardness. You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess and these rounds need not be consecutive.

EARTH
Tremor Step (Su): While standing on a solid, natural surface (caves or fields would both work; the upper floors of a tower would not) you may strike the earth to produce highly localized seismic vibrations. All creatures except you standing on the ground within 20 feet of you must make Balance checks (DC 10 + your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) or fall prone. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

EVIL
Torture Strike (Su): One living creature touched (requiring a successful melee touch attack) is wracked by agonizing pain, as if a branding iron had struck bare flesh. You gain a bonus on Intimidate checks against an affected creature equal to your cleric level for 1 minute. In addition, the target creature also takes 1d4 points of Strength damage and is nauseated for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) reduces the condition to sickened and negates the Strength damage. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

FIRE
Flame-Guiding Song (Su): Your voice has a hypnotic power over fire. You can cause flames to lash out at those nearby, attacking one foe within 10 feet of an existing blaze. These hungry flames deal 2d6 points of fire damage and might cause the target to catch fire. The Reflex save DC to avoid catching on fire or to extinguish these flames equals 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier. You may also use this ability to automatically extinguish nonmagical fires no larger than a bonfire. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

GOOD
Saving Grace (Su): You can grant a divine boon to your allies, assisting them in their endeavors. You can bestow this boon upon an ally within 30 feet as a move action. This boon grants a sacred bonus equal to your Charisma modifier on the next saving throw, attack roll, skill check, or ability check he attempts within the next minute. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

HEALING
Healing Light (Su): You may channel divine energy as a free action to enhance a spell of the healing subschool. When using this ability, such spells with a range of touch may be cast with a range of close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels). You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

KNOWLEDGE
Divine Inspiration (Su): You can glimpse into the mind of your deity, granting you unsurpassed powers of recall and intuition. You can channel divine energy to take to on any Knowledge skill check as if you had ranks in it, even if you are untrained, as a free action. You may add your Charisma bonus to the check in addition to your Intelligence bonus. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to you cleric level.

LAW
Zone of Enforced Order (Su): You can emit an aura that makes chaotic creatures uncomfortable. When in effect, all chaotic creatures within 30 feet of you take a -2 penalty on attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess. These rounds need not be consecutive.

LUCK
Charmed Existence (Su): You may, as an immediate action, use this ability to gain a +2 luck bonus on an attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or ability check. You must decide to use this ability before you roll and may only use this ability once per round. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

MAGIC
Power Magical Device (Su): You can channel divine energy through a wand, staff, or other charged magical item, powering it with faith rather than the item''s own internal reserves. Doing so requires only as much time as is required to activate the item normally (typically a standard action). The magic item produces all its normal effects, but no charge is drained. To power an item, your caster level must be at least equal to the caster level of the item. You cannot use this ability to duplicate spells with an XP or costly material component. Abilities that require multiple charges require you to spend an equal number of uses of this ability. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

PROTECTION
Shield of the Martyr (Su): You can prevent harm to others at the cost of your own safety. Whenever an ally within 30 feet takes damage, you can channel divine energy as an immediate action to split the wounds between the target and yourself (each taking half damage; if an odd number you take the extra point of damage). This ability can only be used once per round and only against a single damage source. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

STRENGTH
Tremendous Might (Su): You can channel divine power into feats of truly superhuman might. You may add a +6 morale bonus on any Strength-based skill check or Strength check required to break, lift, drag, or push on object. This does not apply to attack or damage rolls, including grapple, sunder, or bull rush attempts. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

SUN
Vengeance of Day (Su): Rays of light brighter than the noon sun burst from your raised holy symbol. All within a 30 foot cone must make Will saves (DC 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your Charisma modifier) or be dazzled for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1 round). Undead and creatures with light blindness or light sensitivity, such as kobolds or drow, are blinded instead on a failed save. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1).

TRAVEL
Second Wind (Su): You touch your holy symbol to a creature, imbuing it with renewed vigor for travel and great speed. You can remove the fatigued condition or make an exhausted creature merely fatigued. If the target creature has neither of these conditions, this ability instead increases the creature''s base speed by +30 feet for 1 round. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

TRICKERY
Miraculous Deception (Su): You can channel divine power to improve the skills you naturally develop in service of your trickster deity. Using this ability grants you a +4 divine bonus on a single Bluff, Disguise, or Hide skill check. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to your cleric level.

WAR
Piercing Steel Talon (Su): When wielding your deity''s chosen weapon, you can channel divine energy into a single deadly blow. You instinctively attack the weakest points of your target''s defenses, allowing you to, as a free action, ignore either the target''s armor or shield bonus to AC for a single attack. You may use this ability once per day for every two cleric levels you possess (minimum 1), but no more than once per round.

WATER
Waves Protect Their Own (Su): When at least waist deep in water, you can summon a vortex of swift currents and crashing waves to aid your allies and buffet your enemies. Allies within 30 feet suffer no penalties for underwater combat (as if under a freedom of movement effect) and suffer no risk of drowning in even the roughest seas (although if they choose to dive below the waves they can hold their breath no longer than normal). Enemies in the area take a penalty on attack rolls equal to your Charisma modifier due to the impeding flow of the water (having a swim speed does not negate this penalty, although a freedom of movement effect does). You may use this ability 1 round per day per cleric level you possess. These rounds need not be consecutive.

No Turning
As any acolyte knows, the first divine skill taught to neophytes is the channeling of raw positive or negative energy through a properly prepared holy symbol. Most students talented enough to cast spells have trained in this ability to the point where it can drive away and even destroy undead - or when reversed, control them. Yet, not all such individuals learn to turn the undead. Some focus this divine energy to excel in their own area of expertise while others eschew the ability entirely in favor of more mundane skills. Such individuals embrace this difference, identifying themselves not simply as clerics, but with titles that reflect their specialties, such as warrior priests, theologians, or cultists.

CULTIST
You are secretly a worshiper of a dark god, plotting foul intrigues with others of your secretive cult.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Bluff checks. As long as you carry your holy symbol, you are immune to magical attempts to uncover falsehoods, such as discern lies, zone of truth, and similar effects.

EVANGELIST
You travel far and wide, making showy public sermons and seeking converts to your religion.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on diplomacy checks. An innate talent for magic grants you the following spell-like ability as a 1st-level caster: 2/day - comprehend languages. At 7th level, you gain the following spell-like ability as a 7th-level caster: 1/day - tongues.

FANATIC
You are willing to die in the name of your deity, but you''re even quicker to kill in his name.

HEALER
You care most about curing the sick and injured, no matter whom they serve or what the circumstance.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Heal checks. Whenever you cast a conjuration (healing) spell on a creature other than yourself, you gain a +2 sacred bonus to Armor Class and a +2 sacred bonus on Concentration checks to cast defensively until the end of your next turn.

JUSTICAR
The cleric of a deity of honor, justice, or truth, you seek to take prisoners alive for interrogation and fair punishment.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Sense Motive checks. Whenever you deal enough damage to reduce a creature to negative hit points, the creature automatically and immediately stabilizes.

MYSTIC
Deities operate beyond the understanding of most men. So do you.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain an extra spell one level lower than the highest level spell you can currently cast. This extra spell is always one level lower than the highest-level spell you can cast, so when you gain the ability to cast a higher-level spell the level of the spell slot gained through this ability also increases.

RELIC HUNTER
Your church tasks you to hunt down and reclaim holy - or perhaps unholy - relics.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum +1). Additionally, Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Search are always considered class skills for you.

SAGE
The keeper of ancient truths and lores, you frequently study the antiquarian writings of your faith.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks. In addition, once per day, you may reroll a Knowledge check. You must take the second roll, even if it isn''t as good as the original.

After a career of scribing sacred doctrine and composing prayers, writing religious texts is second nature to you.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat. In addition, the experience point cost to scribe a scroll is reduced by 25%, to a minimum of 1 XP.

SHAMAN
You are the wise elder and healer of a of a wilderness-dwelling tribe.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead and literacy (you are illiterate).

Benefit: You gain an animal companion as a druid of half your cleric level. Half your cleric levels stack with levels of any other classes entitled to an animal companion (such as the druid and ranger) for the purpose of determining your companion''s abilities and the alternative lists available to you.

THEOLOGIAN
You are a wise and respected philosopher, frequently meditating to comprehend the nature of the divine.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks. As long as you conspicuously wear or carry your deity''s holy symbol you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to resist divine spells, as well as the spells and spell-like abilities of outsiders.

WANDERER
Never staying in one plate for long, you travel the world on an endless religious quest, following the subtle signs and portents your deity leaves you.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (local), Speak Language, and Survival are class skills for you. You gain Endurance as a bonus feat at 1st level.

WARRIOR PRIEST
As much a soldier as a member of the clergy, you fight to protect your church, your fellow worshipers, and your ideals.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: Once per day, you may cast a quickened version of a spell you have prepared (that wasn''t prepared as a quickened spell) targeting your weapon, shield, or armor. The spell''s level does not increase because of this ability.

WEAPONMASTER
You have devoted yourself to the mastery of your deity''s favored weapon.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain a +2 bonus on Craft (weaponsmith). As long as you wield your deity''s favored weapon you no longer need a free hand in order to cast spells. Essentially, you substitute movements of your weapon for the somatic components of spells.

Peripheral Beliefs
Religions are steeped in dogma and traditions. The dogma of a religion almost always comes directly from the deities whom the religion reveres. Traditions, on the other hand, sometimes form for reasons that have little to do with the faith''s deity. This article presents five sample peripheral beliefs, from which you may choose up to two. If a cleric violates a belief for any reason he loses its benefit until he receives an atonement spell.

DAILY PRAYER
At specific times of day, you must perform a prayer while facing a specific direction.

Restrictions: You must stop to pray at the appropriate times, regardless of your current situation. Most deities require at least three 5-minute prayers each day (dawn, noon, and sunset) but stricter lawful deities may also require prayers at mid-morning and mid-afternoon.

Benefits: Since you must always face the proper direction while praying, you can automatically discern true north as if you had 5 ranks in Survival. If you already have 5 ranks in Survival you gain a +2 bonus on all Survival checks instead.

DAY OF REST
Every seventh day, you must refrain from all physical activity, regardless of whether you are in town, on the road, or in the dungeon.

Restrictions: On the designated day, you cannot take attack actions, cast spells with somatic components, activate mechanical devices, or carry a load heavier than light.

Benefits: Due to being especially well-rested, you gain a +4 bonus on all saves made against sleep effects and you do not suffer a -10 penalty when making Listen checks while asleep.

DIETARY RESTRICTION
You believe a certain kind of food - such as all meat from a certain kind of animal or from any animal not slain in a specific way - is unclean. Any utensils or dishes used with unclean food themselves become unclean and taint any other food they touch.

Restrictions: Any food prepared by someone other than a devout follower of the religion, or any potion that is not created by the cleric, violate these standards of cleanliness. (A detect poison spell can detect these foods, since the cleric perceives such fare as spiritual poison.)

Benefits: Due to the careful choice of foods, the cleric is especially healthy and gains a +1 bonus on Fortitude saves against poisons and diseases.

SACRED ANIMAL
You consider some particular kind of animal sacred, such as cats, cows, or birds. You cannot harm or impede a sacred animal in any way and you must attempt to prevent others from harming or impeding one.

Restrictions: You cannot attack the sacred creature, even in self-defense. If your allies choose to attack such a creature in self-defense, you must ensure the creature survives, such as binding its wounds once it goes unconscious. If your allies are the aggressors, you cannot cast beneficial spells on them for 24 hours after the combat ends.

Benefits: Animals of the sacred kind feel a special affinity for you and instinctively avoid attacking you unless in self-defense or under magical compulsion (this benefit does not extend to your allies). In addition, you gain a +4 bonus on all Charisma-based skill checks when interacting with such creatures.

SACRED CLOTHING
You must wear some particular item of clothing that takes up a magic item slot, such as a head covering or a ceremonial glove, at all times.

Restrictions: Since the special clothing must be both worn and displayed as a show of devotion, you cannot cover up or remove it. This often means you must forego use of magic items that would be worn in that slot. It might also cause you to commit violations of etiquette in social situations.

Benefits: The special item of clothing is of masterwork quality and costs at least 25 gp. Wearing it grants you a +2 bonus on Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with other followers of your religion and it may be enhanced using normal magic item creation rules. A set of armor or other item that grants you benefits cannot count as your sacred clothing.

Planar Banishment
Instead of channeling energy to turn or rebuke undead, with this variant a cleric can channel energy to banish outsiders.

Make a turning check as normal. The result indicates the most powerful outsider affected (treat an outsider as having Hit Dice equal to its Hit Dice + its Cha modifier, if any). if the roll is high enough to let the cleric affect at least some outsiders within 60 feet, roll 2d6 + cleric''s class level + cleric''s Cha modifier for turning damage. That''s how many total Hit Dice of outsiders the cleric affects.

Any outsider affected by the turning attempt is banished back to its home plane. (If it is already on its home plane, there is no effect.) Even if it has the ability to travel between planes, it cannot do so for 10 rounds (1 minute). If the cleric has twice as many levels (or more) as the outsider has effective Hit Dice, he destroys any outsiders that he would normally banish.

If the cleric would normally turn or destroy undead, he has the ability to banish or destroy evil outsiders (that is, outsiders with the evil subtype). Characters who would normally rebuke or command undead instead gain the ability to banish or destroy good outsiders. As an additional option, the game master might allow clerics worshiping a lawful deity to banish or destroy chaotic outsiders, while clerics worshiping a chaotic deity could banish or destroy lawful outsiders. This ability would replace the ability to banish or destroy good or evil outsiders.

If you use this variant, consider allowing clerics who can turn or rebuke elementals (that is, clerics with access to the Air, Earth, Fire, or Water domains) to instead banish elementals of the same element and banish or destroy elementals of the opposing element.

This variant is otherwise identical to turning undead, including limits of daily uses and feats that enhance a cleric''s turning ability.


Planar Cleric
Clerics who focus on the planes trade their ability to turn undead for control over extraplanar creatures. Outsiders view skilled planar clerics with awe or fear.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a cleric planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 4th, 7th, or 11th level of cleric.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Cleric planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the cleric''s planar substitution levels.

Planar Dismissal (Su): By selecting this planar substitution benefit at 4th level, a cleric trades away some of his power over undead creatures to gain the ability to dismiss a summoned extraplanar creature (such as a fiendish wolf brought by a summon monster II spell) by channeling the power of his faith through his holy (or unholy) symbol.

To attempt this, the cleric spends a turn/rebuke attempt and makes a level check (1d20 + cleric level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the summoner. If the summoning creature doesn''t have a caster level, use its Hit Dice instead. The cleric gets a +2 bonus on this check if the summoned creature''s alignment has at least one component opposed to his own (for instance, a lawful good cleric gets a +2 bonus if the creature''s alignment includes either the chaotic or evil component, while a lawful neutral cleric gains the bonus only against chaotic summoned creatures.) Success indicates that the summoned creature is returned to its home plane.

Each attempt affects only a single creature, chosen by the cleric, that is within 60 feet and visible to the cleric. A cleric can''t dismiss a summoned creature whose Hit Dice exceed his caster level + his Cha modifier.

A cleric who selects this planar substitution benefit reduces his cleric level by three for the purpose of turning undead. For example, a 4th-level cleric with the planar dismissal ability turns undead as a 1st-level cleric.

Planar Domain: A 7th-level cleric whose alignment is other than neutral can give up the two domains that he gained as a 1st-level cleric in exchange for a planar domain that matches his alignment (see Table: Planar Domains). The cleric need not worship a deity listed as one of the typical deities for the domain. A neutral cleric can''t select a planar domain.

The cleric immediately loses the granted powers of his exchanged domains. Skills that were treated as class skills due to a granted power are treated as cross-class skills for this and all future cleric class levels (though the cleric doesn''t lose any skill ranks for skill points already spent from previous levels). He can no longer fill domain spell slots with domain spells from the exchanged domains.

In return, the cleric gains a planar domain that matches his alignment, gains its granted power, and from now on may fill his domain spell slots with the spells appropriate to that domain.

Table: Planar Domains

Domain	Required Alignment
Abyss	Chaotic evil
Arborea	Chaotic good
Baator	Lawful evil
Celestia	Lawful good
Elysium	Neutral good
Hades	Neutral evil
Limbo	Chaotic neutral
Mechanus	Lawful neutral
Planar Banishment (Su): By selecting this planar substitution benefit at 11th level, a cleric trades away his ability to spontaneously cast cure or inflict spells of 6th level or higher in order to gain the ability to banish extraplanar creatures from his home plane. The cleric can "lose" any prepared spell of 6th level or higher that is not a domain spell in order to cast banishment. (If the cleric loses a spell of 7th level or higher, calculate the save DC as if the banishment spell had been heightened to that level.)

Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
4th	+3	+4	+1	+4	Planar dismissal	Same as cleric

11th	+8/+3	+7	+3	+7	Planar banishment	Same as cleric

Pool of Healing
By sacrificing some of your personal power, you permanently establish a link to the Positive Energy Plane through your deity or belief system. The energy you draw from that plane obeys your direct command, and you can dispense it in the form of healing with a simple touch.

Level: 7th.

Replaces: To select this class feature, you must permanently sacrifice one of your 4th-level spell slots.

Benefit: You establish a pool of positive energy that you can use to heal yourself or others. This pool contains enough positive energy to heal an amount of damage equal to 5 x (1 + your divine caster level) hit points per day. As a standard action, you can dole it out with a touch, expending as much or as little of the pool at a time as you wish in much the same way as a paladin does with her lay on hands ability. The pool automatically replenishes every time you prepare spells for the day.

You can also deal out this positive energy with a melee touch attack against any creature vulnerable to positive energy (such as undead), damaging it as if you had cast a cure spell upon it.

For example, Jozan, a 7th-level cleric of Pelor, gives up one of his 4th-level spell slots to set up his pool of healing. Every day, he can heal up to 5 x (1 + 7) = 40 points of damage, or deal that amount of damage to creatures powered by negative energy, or use the energy for a combination of those effects, up to the maximum available. At 10th level, he can heal up to 55 points of damage using this ability.

Pool of healing is a spell-like ability.

Positive Healing
By imparting a portion of the divine energies he commands into an ally, the lightbringer cleric sustains his friend against injuries.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: One domain granted power.

Benefit: A lightbringer cleric can use one of his turn undead uses for the day to internalize the influx of positive energy and so gains fast healing 2 for 5 rounds. This is a supernatural ability.

Purple Staff Cleric
The Followers of the Purple Staff are a group of divine spellcasters trying to create a benign theocracy in the eastern part of the Dragon Coast. These clerics carry a great deal of political power within the borders of the so-called "Holy Realm" and use their magic to aid the citizens of their new land.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Purple Staff substitution level, a character must have Chauntea, Helm, Lathander, Nobanion, Selune, or Sune as his patron deity, be a member of the Fellowship of the Purple Staff, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 4th, 6th, or 9th level of cleric.

Class Skills
Purple Staff substitution levels have the class skills of the standard cleric class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.


Table: Purple Staff Cleric Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
4th	+3	+4	+1	+4	Spontaneous faith healing	See text
6th	+4	+5	+2	+5	Imbue with spell ability	See text
9th	+6/+1	+6	+3	+6	Turn invader	See text
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Purple Staff substitution levels.

Spontaneous Faith Healing (Su): At 4th level, a Purple Staff cleric gains the ability to spontaneously convert prepared cleric spells of 1st level or higher to cast faith healing in the same way she can convert them to cure spells. Armed with this power, a Purple Staff cleric is easily able to deal with even the most severe injuries that common folk might suffer.

This class feature replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 4th level. From this point forward, a Purple Staff cleric has one less 2nd-level spell slot than normal.

Imbue with Spell Ability (Sp): At 6th level, a Purple Staff cleric can use an imbue with spell ability effect to imbue a creature with a single 0- or 1st-level spell she has prepared. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-half her class level. With this power, an adventuring Purple Staff cleric can leave nonspellcaster lieutenants in town to act on her behalf in emergencies or to spread out her spells to help defend a larger area (though she is not limited to these purposes, of course).

This class feature replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard cleric at 6th level. From this point forward, a Purple Staff cleric has one less 3rd-level spell slot than normal.

Turn Invader (Su): At 9th level, a Purple Staff cleric is so devoted to protecting his homeland that he can use his ability to turn undead to frighten enemies of the Holy Realm. When standing within the borders of his country, he can turn hostile monsters or enemies of the Holy Realm as a good-aligned cleric turns undead. He cannot destroy such creatures outright using this ability.

Rage Cleric
The deities of the core D&D pantheon span the spectrum of both alignment and temperament. Their clerics display equal variety when it comes to domain spells, customs, and codes of conduct. Why should a cleric of a wild warrior deity like Gruumsh or Kord equip himself in heavy armor, or even learn its use, when his barbaric flock enters battle with only fury and courage for protection?

The archetypical D&D cleric, with his mace and full plate displayed as prominently as his holy symbol, is as much a warrior as a spellcaster. In a similar vein, the rage cleric presents his divinely-inspired fighting arts just as proudly, although they take a very different form.

A rage cleric has the barbarian''s rage ability. Although this greatly increases his melee prowess, it also limits his spellcasting ability in the heat of combat. The rage cleric''s lower base attack bonus and d8 Hit Dice make him a far less effective frontline fighter than a barbarian, but if he prepares himself with spells beforehand he becomes a formidable berserker.

Most rage clerics follow deities who grant access to the Chaos, Strength, and War domains. On rare occasions, neutral clerics of lawful war deities adopt this class, but such wild warrior-priests walk a fine line between losing their deities'' favor and capitalizing on their signature ability.

Rage clerics often begin their careers as barbarians, but at some point they experience a spiritual awakening that leads them down the path of the faithful.

Humans, dwarves, and half-orcs make up the majority of rage clerics. Elves, although chaotically inclined, usually lack the inner ferocity necessary to turn that chaos into a barbaric rage. Orc clerics, on the other hand, almost always adopt this variant class, which personifies the will of their barbaric deities. Many savage humanoids and lesser giants also favor it.

The rage cleric is a variant cleric. Unless otherwise noted, a rage cleric advances in the same manner as a cleric (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of cleric or rage cleric, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level cleric twice.

Alignment: A rage cleric cannot be lawful but must still be within one step of his deity''s alignment.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the rage cleric class.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A rage cleric is proficient with all simple weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Rage: A rage cleric rages as a barbarian of equal level and gains the greater rage, indomitable will, tireless rage, and mighty rage class features as he progresses. Rage cleric and barbarian levels stack for the purposes of determining the number of times per day a character can enter a rage and the type of rage variant available.

In exchange, a rage cleric loses his ability to turn or rebuke undead as well as his ability to gain domains (which includes domain granted powers and domain spells).

Ex-Rage Clerics
A rage cleric who becomes lawful loses his rage abilities. However, provided that his deity accepts lawful-aligned clerics, he can continue to advance in this class and gain spells.

A rage cleric who grossly violates the code of conduct required by his deity (generally by acting in a manner contrary to the deity''s alignment or purposes) loses all spells and class features, except for rage and proficiency with light armor and simple weapons. He cannot continue to advance in this class until he atones (see the atonement spell).

Raptoran Cleric
The raptoran cleric gains extra powers from his dedication to the pact made between his race and the denizens of the Elemental Plane of Air. While not as combat-oriented as a typical cleric, a raptoran cleric can bring powerful servants of air to do his bidding.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a raptoran cleric substitution level, a character must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 7th level of cleric. A raptoran cleric must have selected either the Air domain or the Sky domain to select a raptoran cleric substitution level.

Class Skills
Raptoran cleric substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard cleric class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Raptoran Cleric Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+0	+2	+0	+2	Air mastery, empathy of the winds, turn or rebuke undead	Same as cleric
3rd	+2	+3	+1	+3	Air summoning talent	Same as cleric
7th	+5	+5	+2	+5	Open the wind-gate	Same as cleric
Class Features
All the following are features of the raptoran cleric''s racial substitution levels.

Air Mastery (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, airborne creatures take a -1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a raptoran cleric.

This substitution feature replaces the standard cleric''s heavy armor proficiency gained at 1st level.

Empathy of the Winds (Ex): A 1st-level raptoran cleric gains a strong bond with air and its denizens. He learns Auran as a bonus language (in addition to the languages available to him because of his race and the Speak Language skill). He gains a +4 circumstance bonus on Diplomacy checks made to interact with natives of the Elemental Plane of Air. If he has the ability to bolster air creatures (such as from the Air domain), he gains a +4 bonus on turning checks made to do so. Allied air elementals within 60 feet of the cleric gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls.

Air Summoning Talent (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, a raptoran cleric can summon certain creatures of air more easily than other clerics can. Add the following monsters to the list of creatures that the cleric can summon with the appropriate summon monster spell:

Summon monster II: Small air elemental

Summon monster III: Air mephit

Summon monster IV: Medium air elemental

Summon monster V: Large air elemental

Summon monster VI: Huge air elemental

Summon monster VII: Greater air elemental

Summon monster VIII: Elder air elemental

This substitution feature removes all spells with the earth descriptor from the standard cleric''s spell list. If a spell would only have the earth descriptor due to a particular version of the spell (such as a summon monster spell used to summon an earth elemental), the spell remains on the cleric''s spell list but the version with the earth descriptor cannot be cast.

Open the Wind-Gate (Ex): A 7th-level raptoran cleric can use the planar ally spells to call a more powerful air elemental than would normally be allowed. The cleric can call an 8 HD Large air elemental with lesser planar ally, a single 16 HD Huge air elemental (or two 8 HD Large air elementals) with planar ally, or a single 24 HD elder air elemental (or multiple Large and/or Huge air elementals totaling 24 HD) with greater planar ally.

The costs associated with these spells remain the same. However, if any of the called air elementals die while in the service of the cleric, the cleric loses access to this ability for seven days and takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, saves, and checks during that period.

This substitution feature replaces the standard cleric''s ability to call creatures other than air elementals with the various planar ally spells.

Rebuke Dragons
Though the destruction (or control) of undead is common to many divinely oriented characters, the deities also recognize the ancient power of the dragons as a primal force. Some reward their followers with the ability to instill such creatures with awe or command them as minions.

Class: Cleric or paladin.

Level: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You channel divine energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) dragons. This ability functions as an evil cleric rebuking undead.

It is more difficult to rebuke or command dragons that share your moral or ethical bent. Any dragon that shares one alignment component with you is treated as having turn resistance +2 against this ability. Any dragon that shares both alignment components with you is treated as having turn resistance +4 against this ability.

You can also use this ability to bolster a dragon against an attempt by another creature to use its own rebuke dragons ability (the same way an evil cleric can bolster undead against turning). To bolster a dragon, you must share at least one alignment component with the dragon.

An attempt to rebuke dragons counts as an attempt to turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for or activating divine feats, or for using other abilities that require you to expend a use of your turn or rebuke ability.


Spontaneous Domain Casting
After a while, clerics can start looking very similar. Even with a variety of domains to choose from, domain spells take up such a small portion of the average cleric''s repertoire that they don''t have much effect on the overall feel of the character. With spontaneous domain casting, though, your domain choice becomes a more important element of your character. You won''t be able to provide as much healing to your party as a typical cleric, but the ability to prepare cure or inflict spells in your domain spell slots keeps you from falling too far behind in that area.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into cure or inflict spells.

Benefit: You can convert stored spell energy into the spells of one of your domains. Pick one of your two domains. You can "lose" any prepared spell (other than a domain spell) to cast any spell of the same level or lower on that domain list. Your choice is permanent unless an alignment change, deity change, or other dramatic event leaves you incapable of accessing the domain.

In addition, when preparing spells you can choose to fill any or all of your domain spell slots with either cure or inflict spells (depending on whether you would normally convert prepared spells to cure or inflict spells) of the same level.

For example, Crucius is a cleric of Heironeous with the Good and War domains. At 1st level, he chooses to spontaneously cast War domain spells. Thereafter, he can lose a prepared 1st-level spell to cast magic weapon, a prepared 2nd-level spell to cast spiritual weapon (or magic weapon), and so on. Furthermore, in each domain spell slot he can prepare a spell from the Good domain, a spell from the War domain, or a cure spell of the same level.

True Daylight
Lightbringer clerics, as befits their name, are capable of channeling divine energy in the form of pure sunlight.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: One domain granted power.

Benefit: A lightbringer cleric can use up one of his turn undead uses for the day to empower a daylight spell he casts with positive energy. The resulting daylight effect has a smaller radiance radius and a shorter, inconstant duration; however, the daylight created is the equivalent of daylight for the purpose of its effect on creatures that are damaged or destroyed by bright light (such as vampires).

The effect created by this ability sheds true daylight in a 10-foot radius and has a duration of 1d4 rounds (roll to determine each time this ability is used). This is an extraordinary ability.

Turning Presence
The standard rules for turning undead allow a cleric to affect a relatively narrow band of undead (up to 4 HD greater than his cleric level). This makes many undead creatures "off limits" for this iconic power of the cleric. This variant changes the cleric''s turning check into a battle of personality strength, representing it by a level check that also takes into account the opponents'' Charisma scores.

When turning undead using this variant, the cleric makes a turning check against the closest creature first, followed by a separate check against the next closest, and so on. When two or more creatures are equally close, the creature with the lowest number of Hit Dice is affected first (if it''s still a tie, the character chooses which is affected first). Creatures more than 60 feet away cannot be turned.

A turning check is a level check to which the character also adds his Charisma modifier. (Use the character''s effective turning level, which is equal to class level for a cleric or class level -3 for a paladin.) The DC is 10 + the creature''s Hit Dice + its turn resistance (if any) + its Charisma modifier. (To speed play, the game master can add a "Turn DC" score to the statistics block of each undead creature.)

If you use this variant, some creatures'' turn resistance should be increased to keep them from being too easy to turn. Any creature with turn resistance of +4 or higher should gain an additional +2 to its turn resistance. Creatures with turn resistance of +3 or lower need no change.

If the check fails, the creature is unaffected. Its Hit Dice do not count against the total number of creatures the character can turn (see below).

If the character succeeds on the check, the affected creature stands frozen in place for 1 round, just as if it were paralyzed (though this affects even creatures with immunity to paralysis). On each succeeding turn, the character may take a standard action to concentrate on the effect, prolonging the effective paralysis for an additional round. (This doesn''t count as a turn attempt, and affects all undead creatures that the character has "paralyzed" in this manner.) The character may concentrate on this effect for a maximum of 10 consecutive rounds, after which the undead creature can act normally. If a creature affected in this way is attacked or takes damage, the effect is broken and the creature may act normally beginning on its next turn. (The character''s proximity to the creature has no effect.) This effect is the same whether the character channels positive or negative energy.

If the character''s check beats the DC by 5 or more, he may instead turn the creature (if he channels positive energy) or rebuke it (if he channels negative energy).

If the creature has Hit Dice equal to one-half the character''s effective cleric level or less, the turning attempt automatically succeeds, and he does not have to make a check (the creature''s Hit Dice still count against the maximum). Furthermore, such undead are automatically destroyed (if the character channels positive energy) or commanded (if he channels negative energy).

The character makes checks against each eligible creature until he has affected the maximum Hit Dice worth of creatures, or there are no more eligible creatures. He can affect a number of Hit Dice of creatures equal to three × his effective cleric level on any one turning attempt. For example, a 4th-level cleric (or 7th-level paladin) can affect up to 12 HD worth of creatures, which could mean two creatures with 6 HD each, four creatures with 3 HD each, or any other combination that adds up to 12 HD.

An evil cleric can instead channel negative energy to bolster undead or to dispel a turning effect. In either case, the cleric makes a normal turning check (if attempting to dispel a turning effect, add the turning cleric''s Charisma modifier to the DC of the evil cleric''s turning check. if the cleric successfully rebukes the undead, the undead gain turn resistance +2 (if he was attempting to bolster them) or are no longer turned (if he was attempting to dispel the turning effect).

For example, a 3rd-level cleric, faces three ghouls and a ghast. The cleric can turn up to 9 HD of creatures. Two of the ghouls are 10 feet and 15 feet away, respectively. The third ghoul and the ghast are both 20 feet away. His turning attempts affect the closest ghouls first, then the farthest ghoul, and then the ghast. The cleric makes the first turning check. A ghoul has 2 HD, but it also has +2 turn resistance, so it is treated as a 4 HD creature. After adding the ghoul''s +1 Charisma modifier, the turning check DC is 15. The cleric rolls a 12, which, with his three cleric levels and +1 Charisma modifier, gives him a result of 16, so the nearest ghoul is halted in place. (If the cleric wants to maintain the effect, he''ll have to continue to concentrate on it in later rounds.) He has successfully turned 4 HD worth of creatures, leaving him with 5 HD. This is enough to affect another ghoul, so he makes another turning check against the next closest ghoul. the cleric rolls a 6 against the second ghoul, for a result of 10, so the ghoul is unaffected. Against the third ghoul, his roll is 16 for a result of 20, which beats the DC by at least 5, so the cleric can turn the ghoul if he wishes to do so. Since he knows he can''t affect the ghast on this turning attempt—it has 4 HD and 2 turn resistance, and the cleric has only 1 HD of turning left — he chooses to paralyze the third ghoul rather than sending it scurrying back into its burrow where it can gather more allies. (Even if the cleric had failed to affect the third ghoul, he would only have 5 HD left — not enough to affect the ghast thanks to its +2 turn resistance.) On his next turn, the cleric can choose to continue holding the ghouls in place or, if his allies have already destroyed the three ghouls, use another turning attempt against the ghast (which requires a DC 19 turning check).',

    description = 'The fury of a storm, the gentle strength of the morning sun, the cunning of the fox, the power of the bear - all these and more are at the druid''s command. The druid however, claims no mastery over nature. That claim, she says, is the empty boast of a city dweller. The druid gains her power not by ruling nature but by being at one with it. To trespassers in a druid''s sacred grove, and to those who feel her wrath, the distinction is overly fine.

Druids adventure to gain knowledge (especially about animals and plants unfamiliar to them) and power. Sometimes, their superiors call on their services. Druids may also bring their power to bear against those who threaten what they love, which more often includes ancient stands of trees or trackless mountains than people. While druids accept that which is horrific or cruel in nature, they hate that which is unnatural, including aberrations (such as beholders and carrion crawlers) and undead (such as zombies and vampires). Druids sometimes lead raids against such creatures, especially when they encroach on the druids'' territory.

Druids cast divine spells much the same way clerics do, though most get their spells from the power of nature rather than from deities. Their spells are oriented toward nature and animals. In addition to spells, druids gain an increasing array of magical powers, including the ability to take the shapes of animals, as they advance in level.

The armor of a druid are restricted by traditional oaths to the items noted in Weapon and Armor proficiency (below),All other armor is prohibited. Though a druid could learn to wear full plate, putting it on would violate her oath and suppress her druidic powers. Druids avoid carrying much worked metal with them because it interferes with the pure and primal nature that they attempt to embody.

Druids, in keeping with nature''s ultimate indifference, must maintain at least some measure of dispassion. As such, they must be neutral on at least one alignment axis (chaotic-lawful or good-evil), if not both. Just as nature encompasses such dichotomies as life and death, beauty and horror, and peace and violence, so two druids can manifest different or even opposite alignments (neutral good and neutral evil, for instance) and still be part of the druidic tradition.

A druid reveres nature above all. She gains her magical power either from the force of nature itself or from a nature deity. The typical druid pursues a mystic spirituality of transcendent union with nature rather than devoting herself to a divine entity. Still, some druids revere or at least respect either Obad-Hai (god of nature) or Ehlonna (goddess of the woodlands).

Though their organization is invisible to most outsiders, who consider druids to be loners, druids are actually part of a society that spans the land, ignoring political borders. A prospective druid is inducted into this society through secret rituals, including tests that not all survive. Only after achieving some level of competence is the druid allowed to strike out on her own.

All druids are nominally members of this druidic society, though some individuals are so isolated that they have never seen any highranking members of the society or participated in druidic gatherings. All druids recognize each other as brothers and sisters. Like true creatures of the wilderness, however, druids sometimes compete with or even prey on each other.

A druid may be expected to perform services for higher-ranking druids, though proper payment is tendered for such assignments. Likewise, a lower-ranking druid may appeal for aid from her higher-ranking comrades in exchange for a fair price in coin or service.

Druids may live in small towns, but they always spend a good portion of their time in wild areas. Even large cities surrounded by cultivated land as far as the eye can see often have druid groves nearby - small, wild refuges where druids live and which they protect fiercely. Near coastal cities, such refuges may be nearby islands, where the druids can find the isolation they need.

Elves and gnomes have an affinity for natural lands and often become druids. Humans and halfelves also frequently adopt this path, and druids are particularly common among savage humans. Dwarves, halflings, and half-orcs are rarely druids.

Few from among the brutal humanoids are inducted into druidic society, though gnolls have a fair contingent of evil druids among them. Gnoll druids are accepted, though perhaps not welcomed, by druids of other races.

The druid shares with rangers and many barbarians a reverence for nature and a familiarity with natural lands. She doesn''t much understand the urban mannerism typical of a rogue, and she finds arcane magic disruptive and slightly distasteful. The typical druid also dislikes the paladin''s devotion to abstract ideals instead of "the real world." Druids, however, are nothing if not accepting of diversity, and they take little offense at other characters, even those very different from them.

The druid enjoys extraordinary versatility. Though she lacks the sheer healing power of the cleric, she makes up for it with additional offensive power, thanks to her spell selection and wild shape ability. A druid back up by another secondary healer (such as a paladin) can prove extremely valuable to a group of adventurers. Her animal companion also provides valuable melee combat support.

Alignment: Neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, chaotic neutral, or neutral evil.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the druid.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).

Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description.) Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.

A druid who wears prohibited armor or carries a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

Spells: A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the druid spell list. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells, below. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid''s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid''s Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. She does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.

A druid prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place (but see Spontaneous Casting, below). A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

Spontaneous Casting: A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn''t prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature''s ally spell of the same level or lower.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: A druid can''t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity''s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.

Bonus Languages: A druid''s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn''t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids. Druidic has its own alphabet.

Animal Companion (Ex): A druid may begin play with an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures are also available: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures as appropriate for its kind.

A 1st-level druid''s companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted below. As a druid advances in level, the animal''s power increases as shown on the table. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.

A druid of 4th level or higher may select from alternative lists of animals (see below). Should she select an animal companion from one of these alternative lists, the creature gains abilities as if the character''s druid level were lower than it actually is. Subtract the value indicated in the appropriate list header from the character''s druid level and compare the result with the druid level entry on the table to determine the animal companion''s powers. (If this adjustment would reduce the druid''s effective level to 0 or lower, she can''t have that animal as a companion.)

Nature Sense (Ex): A druid gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A druid can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her Charisma modifier to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the druid and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but she takes a -4 penalty on the check.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion still affect her.

Trackless Step (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

Resist Nature''s Lure (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Wild Shape (Su): At 5th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the animal type. This ability functions like the alternate form special ability, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn''t provoke an attack of opportunity. Each time you use wild shape, you regain hit points as if you had rested for a night.

Any gear worn or carried by the druid melds into the new form and becomes nonfunctional. When the druid reverts to her true form, any objects previously melded into the new form reappear in the same location on her body that they previously occupied and are once again functional. Any new items worn in the assumed form fall off and land at the druid''s feet.

The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.

A druid loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)

A druid can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on Table: The Druid. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level. The new form''s Hit Dice can''t exceed the character''s druid level.

At 12th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a plant creature with the same size restrictions as for animal forms. (A druid can''t use this ability to take the form of a plant that isn''t a creature.)

At 16th level, a druid becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) once per day. These elemental forms are in addition to her normal wild shape usage. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, the druid gains all the elemental''s extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. She also gains the elemental''s feats for as long as she maintains the wild shape, but she retains her own creature type.

At 18th level, a druid becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level she can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this wild shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.

Venom Immunity (Ex): At 9th level, a druid gains immunity to all poisons.

A Thousand Faces (Su): At 13th level, a druid gains the ability to change her appearance at will, as if using the disguise self spell, but only while in her normal form. This affects the druid''s body but not her possessions. It is not an illusory effect, but a minor physical alteration of the druid''s appearance, within the limits described for the spell.

Timeless Body (Ex): After attaining 15th level, a druid no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the druid still dies of old age when her time is up.

Ex-Druids
A druid who ceases to revere nature, changes to a prohibited alignment, or teaches the Druidic language to a nondruid loses all spells and druid abilities (including her animal companion, but not including weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She cannot thereafter gain levels as a druid until she atones (see the atonement spell description).

THE DRUID''S ANIMAL COMPANION
A druid''s animal companion is superior to a normal animal of its kind and has special powers, as described below.

Class Level	Bonus HD	Natural Armor Adj.	Str/Dex Adj.	Bonus Tricks	Special
1st-2nd	+0	+0	+0	1	Link, share spells
3rd-5th	+2	+2	+1	2	Evasion
6th-8th	+4	+4	+2	3	Devotion
9th-11th	+6	+6	+3	4	Multiattack
12th-14th	+8	+8	+4	5	�
15th-17th	+10	+10	+5	6	Improved evasion
18th-20th	+12	+12	+6	7	�
Animal Companion Basics: Use the base statistics for a creature of the companion''s kind, but make the following changes.

Class Level: The character''s druid level. The druid''s class levels stack with levels of any other classes that are entitled to an animal companion for the purpose of determining the companion''s abilities and the alternative lists available to the character.

Bonus HD: Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Remember that extra Hit Dice improve the animal companion''s base attack and base save bonuses. An animal companion''s base attack bonus is the same as that of a druid of a level equal to the animal''s HD. An animal companion has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal''s HD). An animal companion gains additional skill points and feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster''s Hit Dice.

Natural Armor Adj.: The number noted here is an improvement to the animal companion''s existing natural armor bonus.

Str/Dex Adj.: Add this value to the animal companion''s Strength and Dexterity scores.

Bonus Tricks: The value given in this column is the total number of "bonus" tricks that the animal knows in addition to any that the druid might choose to teach it (see the Handle Animal skill). These bonus tricks don''t require any training time or Handle Animal checks, and they don''t count against the normal limit of tricks known by the animal. The druid selects these bonus tricks, and once selected, they can''t be changed.

Link (Ex): A druid can handle her animal companion as a free action, or push it as a move action, even if she doesn''t have any ranks in the Handle Animal skill. The druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks made regarding an animal companion.

Share Spells (Ex): At the druid''s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts upon herself also affect her animal companion. The animal companion must be within 5 feet of her at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the animal companion if the companion moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the animal again, even if it returns to the druid before the duration expires. Additionally, the druid may cast a spell with a target of "You" on her animal companion (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A druid and her animal companion can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the companion''s type (animal).

Evasion (Ex): If an animal companion is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, it takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw.

Devotion (Ex): An animal companion gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.

Multiattack: An animal companion gains Multiattack as a bonus feat if it has three or more natural attacks and does not already have that feat. If it does not have the requisite three or more natural attacks, the animal companion instead gains a second attack with its primary natural weapon, albeit at a -5 penalty.

Improved Evasion (Ex): When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, an animal companion takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and only half damage if the saving throw fails.

1 Available only in an aquatic environment.

2 Available only in a subterranean environment.

3 Halfling druids only.

4 Nonhalfling druids only.

5 Raptoran druids only.

6 Nonraptoran druids only.

Druids can begin play with animal companions, which are something like cohorts, and rangers can gain them during their careers. Use the following rules of thumb to adjudicate situations that may arise when characters have animal companions.

While the class descriptions list the animals available as companions, those lists assume the character spends most of her time in the animals'' home territory and treats them well. If she spends most of her time at sea, in cities, or otherwise in places that the animals don''t like, her animals are likely to desert. Remember, these creatures are loyal friends but not pets or servants. They won''t remain loyal if being the character''s friend becomes too onerous.

The animal is still an animal. It''s not a magical beast, as a familiar or a paladin''s mount is. While it may have learned some tricks, it''s still no more intelligent than any other animal of its kind, and it retains all its bestial instincts. Unlike intelligent followers or cohorts, animals can''t follow complex instructions, such as "Attack the gnoll with the wand." A character can give a simple verbal command, such as "Attack" or "Come," as a free action, provided such a command is among the tricks the animal has learned. A more complex instruction, such as telling an animal to attack and pointing out a specific target, is a standard action. Animals are ill-equipped to handle unusual situations, such as combats with invisible opponents, and they typically hesitate to attack weird and unnatural creatures, such as beholders and oozes.

Left to its own judgment, an animal follows a character and attacks creatures that attack her (or that attack the animal itself). To do more than that, it needs to learn tricks as described under the Handle Animal skill.

Aquatic Druid
Druids of the waters are not as common as those inhabiting forests and wild lands. Much of the ocean''s expanse is beyond the reach of humanoids, other than the aquatic varieties, so there is a less pressing need to protect it. However, druids do tend sacred pools and streams and work with the fey that inhabit them. Among fishing peoples, druids tend the harvest and work to ensure that waters are clean and fish plentiful.

Peaceful aquatic peoples such as tritons, merfolk, and sea elves have a larger proportion of druids in their midst than air-breathing humanoids. These worshipers of nature tend coral reefs, kelp forests, and deep places of mystery, and they guard against wanton hunting other or depredations. Druids of ferocious aquatic tribes might lead sacred underwater hunts or battles against air-breathing intruders in their territory.

Woodland Stride (Ex): A druid who has a racial swim speed can choose to apply this ability to difficult aquatic terrain (shallow coral, kelp beds, ice-choked waters, sargasso, and similar obstacles), rather than woodland terrain. This choice is made when the class feature is gained.


Aspect of Nature
Instead of taking animal form, a druid with this variant form of wild shape takes on one or more aspects of nature when she uses her wild shape ability.
At 5th level, a druid may take on one aspect from those described below. At 8th level, the druid can take on up to two aspects simultaneously. At 11th level, she can take up on to three aspects simultaneously, and at 15th level the limit increases to its maximum of four simultaneous aspects. (Some aspects can only be combined with certain other aspects, as indicated in their descriptions.) Each aspect taken on counts as one daily use of the druid''s wild shape ability. Multiple versions of the same aspect don''t stack. Taking on one or more aspects is a standard action (which does not provoke attacks of opportunity), and the effect lasts for 1 minute per druid level.

Some aspects, as noted in their descriptions, have a minimum druid level as a prerequisite.

A druid may take on one aspect per day for every daily use of wild shape she is entitled to. For instance, a 5th-level druid could normally use wild shape once per day, so she could assume an aspect once per day. A 10th-level druid could take on four aspects per day and can choose to take on two aspects simultaneously (which would use up two of the druid''s daily uses).

Unless otherwise noted in an aspect''s description, a druid who assumes an aspect of nature retains her own type and subtype(s), keeps her extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities, and retains her ability to communicate and cast spells. She is considered proficient with any natural attacks granted by the aspect.

Agility: The druid gains a +8 bonus to Dexterity but takes a -4 penalty to Strength. Prerequisite: Druid level 8th.

Aquatic: The druid grows gills, enabling her to breathe underwater (while retaining her ability to breathe air). Webbing between her fingers and her toes grants her a swim speed of 40 feet (or 30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load) and a +8 bonus on her Swim checks.

Elemental Air: The druids body becomes gaseous (as the gaseous form spell, except that she can fly at a speed of 100 feet with perfect maneuverability and doesn''t lose her supernatural abilities while in this form). While in this form, the druid has immunity to poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning, as well as any other immunities provided by the gaseous form spell. The druid cannot cast spells while this aspect is in effect. She can''t combine this aspect with any other aspect except for agility and endurance. Prerequisite: Druid level 16th.

Elemental Earth: The druid''s body becomes stony and rocklike. While in this form, the druid has immunity to�poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. She gains a slam attack that deals bludgeoning damage equal to a morningstar of the druid''s size (1d8 for Medium druids, 1d6 for Small druids). Her natural armor bonus becomes +8 (replacing any other natural armor bonus the druid has, though enhancement bonuses to natural armor still apply normally). She also gains damage reduction 10/magic. The druid cannot cast spells while this aspect is in effect. She can''t combine this aspect with any other aspect except for endurance and vigor. Prerequisite: Druid level 16th.

Elemental Fire: The druid''s body bursts into flame. While in this form, the druid has immunity to fire,�poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. In addition, any creature struck by the druid in melee (whether with a weapon, unarmed attack, or natural weapon) takes an extra 1d6 points of fire damage and must succeed on a Reflex save or catch fire for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is 10 + 1/2 druid level + druid''s Con modifier. Creatures hitting the druid with natural weapons or unarmed attacks while this aspect is in effect take 1d6 points of fire damage and also catch fire unless they succeed on the Reflex save noted above. The druid also gains damage reduction 10/magic. The druid cannot cast spells while this aspect is in effect. She can''t combine this aspect with any other aspect except for agility and endurance. Prerequisite: Druid level 16th.

Elemental Water: The druid''s body becomes semifluid. While in this form, the druid gains a +10 bonus on Escape Artist checks, resistance to fire 10, and immunity to�poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. She gains a swim speed of 90 feet and a +8 bonus on her Swim checks. Her touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these are Large or smaller. The druid can dispel magical fire she touches as if she had cast greater dispel magic on it. She also gains damage reduction 10/magic. The druid cannot cast spells while this aspect is in effect. She can''t combine this aspect with any other aspect except for endurance and vigor. Prerequisite: Druid level 16th.

Endurance: The druid gains a +4 bonus to Constitution. Prerequisite: Druid level 8th.

Flight: The druid grows wings feathery or batlike, at her option) that enable her to fly at a speed of 40 feet with average maneuverability (or 30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a medium or heavy load).

Plant: The druid''s body becomes plantlike. While in this form, the druid gains a +10 bonus on Hide checks made in areas of forest, overgrowth, or similar terrain. She gains immunity to�poison, sleep, paralysis, and stunning. She gains a slam attack that deals bludgeoning damage equal to a light mace of the druid''s size (1d6 for Medium druids, 1d4 for Small druids). Her natural armor bonus becomes 4 (replacing any other natural armor bonus the druid has, though enhancement bonuses to natural armor still apply normally). She can''t combine this aspect with any other aspect except for vigor. Prerequisite: Druid level 12th.

Poison: The druid gains a bite attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage equal to a dagger of the druid''s size (1d4 for a Medium druid, or 1d3 for a Small druid). In addition, the bite delivers a toxic venom (Fortitude save DC 10 + 1/2 druid''s level + druid''s Con modifier; initial and secondary damage 1d6 Con).

Scent: The druid gains the scent ability.

Speed: The druid gains a +30-foot enhancement bonus to her base land speed.

Tooth and Claw: The druid gains a primary bite attack (at her full base attack bonus) and two secondary claw attacks (at her base attack bonus -5 and adding only half her Strength bonus on damage rolls). The bite attack deals bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage equal to a short sword of the druid''s size (1d6 for a Medium druid, or 1d4 for a Small druid), while the claws deal piercing and slashing damage equal to a dagger of the druid''s size (1d4 for a Medium druid, or 1d3 for a Small druid).

Vigor: The druid gains a +8 bonus to Strength but takes a -4 penalty to Dexterity. Prerequisite: Druid level 8th.

Aspect of the Dragon
Most druids revere animals as emblems of the natural world, but a few consider dragons even more deserving of their attention. Those who feel this way show their respect by mimicking physical or mental aspects of dragonkind instead of taking the forms of lesser creatures.

Class: Druid.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wild shape (or any later improvements to that class feature, except for the ability to wild shape into an elemental).

Benefit: You can take on aspects of dragonkind. Taking on one or more aspects is a swift action, and the effect lasts for 1 hour or until you dismiss it (a free action). The various aspects are described below.

At 5th level, you can have only one aspect in effect at a time. At 8th level, you can take on up to two aspects simultaneously. At 11th level, you can take on up to three aspects simultaneously. At 15th level, the limit increases to its maximum of four simultaneous aspects. Each aspect taken on counts as one daily use of the ability (see below). Multiple versions of the same aspect don''t stack.

At 5th level, you can use this ability once per day. You gain additional uses per day at the same rate that you would normally gain uses of wild shape (from two per day at 6th level up to six per day at 18th level).

You are considered proficient with any natural attacks granted by the aspect, and you retain all your special abilities (unless the aspect specifically replaces them, such as the claws of the dragon aspect replacing your own claw attack, if you have one).

Breath of the Dragon: You can breathe a 30-foot cone of fire as a standard action. The cone deals 1d6 points of damage per two druid levels; a successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your druid level + your Con modifier) halves this damage. Each time you breathe, you must wait 1d4 rounds before you can use this breath weapon again.

Claws of the Dragon: You gain a +4 bonus to Strength, and your hands grow claws that can be used as primary natural attacks. Each claw deals a certain amount of damage (1d6 points if you are Medium, 1d4 if you are Small, and 1d8 if you are Large) plus your Strength modifier. These claws are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Heart of the Dragon: You gain a +4 bonus to Constitution and immunity to paralysis.

Mind of the Dragon: You gain a +4 bonus to Wisdom, darkvision out to 60 feet, low-light vision, and immunity to sleep effects.

Wings of the Dragon: You grow draconic wings that allow you to fly at your land speed with good maneuverability. You can''t fly if you are wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load.

City-Shape
The ability to transform into an animal is the hallmark of the druid, so much so that even many urban druids choose to retain it. Some, however, prefer the ability to blend and maneuver within the streets of the city, sacrificing size for a wider range of forms.

Class: Druid.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain all the aspects of standard wild shape (except for the ability to wild shape into an elemental at high levels, which remains unchanged).

Benefit: At 5th level, the druid gains the ability to transform into an animal, as per the standard wild shape ability. She can do this once a day to start with, but the frequency of her wild shapes increases as per the standard druid advancement chart.

At 8th level, the druid does not gain the ability to transform into Large animals. Instead, she may transform into Small and Medium vermin, as well as animals.

At 11th level, the druid gains the ability to transform into Tiny animals and vermin.

At 12th level, the druid does not gain the ability to transform into plant creatures. Instead, she may transform into an animal- or vermin-based swarm, so long as it fits within her standard wild shaping Hit Die limits.

At 15th level, the druid does not gain the ability to transform into Huge animals. Instead, she gains the ability to transform into Large animals and vermin.

Special: The Natural Spell feat functions with city-shape just as it does standard wild shape.

City Soul
The most powerful druids can transform themselves into elementals, representatives of the building blocks of reality itself. A few urban druids, truly taken with the nature and order of the city, prefer more mundane forms.

Class: Druid.

Level: 16th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the wild shape (elemental) ability, or later improvements to that class feature.

Benefit: At 16th level, the druid can use her wild shape (or city-shape) ability to become a Small, Medium, or Large animated object (MM 13) once per day. These forms are in addition to her normal wild shape uses. In addition to the normal effects of wild shape, she gains all the animated object''s extraordinary abilities, as well as many traits of the construct type (low-light vision, darkvision to 60 feet, and immunity to critical hits, poison, disease, paralysis, and stunning).

The precise form must be an object common to the city environment, such as a wagon, a statue, or the like. (Talk to your DM in advance to determine what sorts of forms are available and what are off-limits.)

The druid can assume the form of an animated object twice per day at 18th level, and three times per day at 20th level. At 20th level, she can use this ability to turn into a Huge animated object.

Special: The Natural Spell feat functions with city soul just as it does standard wild shape.

Crowd-Walker
Certain individuals are comfortable among the throngs of citizens in even the most densely packed city. They know how to maneuver deftly through such environs without impediment.

Class: Druid or ranger.

Level: 2nd (druid) or 7th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain woodland stride.

Benefit: When moving through a crowd, the crowd-walker moves at her normal rate, rather than requiring two squares of movement for every square as is normal. In addition, light debris does not impede her movement, and she treats heavy debris as light debris. Any other sort of rough terrain impedes her normally, however.

Dead Levels
The druid is the second-place offender of dead levels. For a class to have special abilities for eighteen out of twenty levels, one wonders how two more abilities would have made a difference, especially at such high levels (17th and 19th level). The two dead level abilities presented here adequately fill those gaps without derailing the original class design.

Woodland Sprint (Ex): At 17th level, a druid may move at her normal speed through thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated. She does not take damage or suffer any other impairment, since she becomes immune to such magical effects.

Repel Nature''s Lure (Ex): At 19th level, a druid gains spell resistance against the spell-like abilities of fey (such as dryads, pixies, and sprites) equal to her current druid level + 10. To affect the druid with a spell-like ability, a fey spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level; see Spell Resistance) that equals or exceeds the druid''s spell resistance.

Domain Druid
With this option, each druid may choose a single domain from the following list: Air, Animal, Earth, Fire, Plant, Sun, and Water. The druid gains a bonus spell of each spell level, which may be used only to prepare a domain spell of that level (or of a lower level, if affected by a metamagic feat). The druid also gains the domain''s granted power, except as noted below.
Druids who select the Animal domain or the Plant domain gain Skill Focus (Knowledge [nature]), since Knowledge (nature) is already a class skill for druids.

A druid who chooses the Sun domain gains the ability to turn undead 1/day as a cleric of her level, and cannot perform a greater turning.


Druidic Avenger
The druidic avenger channels her inner fury to wreak vengeance upon those who injure the natural world. This comes at a price, however, since the avenger must give up some of her own sensitivity to nature.

Class Skills
Add Intimidate to the avenger''s list of class skills. Eliminate Diplomacy from the avenger''s list of class skills.
Class Features
The druidic avenger has all the standard druid class features, except as noted below.

Animal Companion: An avenger does not gain the service of an animal companion.

Fast Movement (Ex): A druidic avenger''s base land speed is faster than the norm for her race by 10 feet. This ability is identical to the barbarian ability of the same name.

Rage (Ex): An avenger can enter a furious rage, identical to that of a barbarian. An avenger can use this ability once per day at 1st level, and one additional time per day for every five levels above 1st.

An avenger does not gain the greater rage, indomitable will, or mighty rage abilities.

Spontaneous Casting: An avenger cannot channel stored spell energy into summoning spells.

Tireless Rage (Ex): At 17th level and higher, an avenger no longer becomes fatigued at the end of her rage.

Wild Empathy: A druidic avenger takes a -4 penalty on wild empathy checks.

Drow Druid
Druids are rare among drow communities. Most drow spellcasters pursue either the faith of Lolth or one of a variety of arcane paths. However, a rare few exist who seek a different, more natural connection between themselves and their subterranean environment.

Drow druids forgo the ability to assume animal forms, preferring the shape of their revered totem: the spider.

Spider Shape
After extensive indoctrination by drow priestesses, you use wild shape to assume the form of vermin.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to wild shape into an animal at 5th level.

Benefit: Beginning at 5th level, you can turn yourself into any Small or Medium monstrous spider. You are not mindless, and thus do not gain immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities.

You can take the shape of a Large monstrous spider at 8th level, a Tiny monstrous spider at 11th level, and a Huge monstrous spider at 15th level.

This class feature otherwise functions as the normal wild shape ability.

It doesn''t affect your ability to wild shape into plant creatures or elementals (gained at 12th and 16th level, as normal).

Special: Because they have a stronger connection to scorpions than to spiders, drow in the EBERRON campaign setting who select this alternative class feature instead gain the ability to wild shape into monstrous scorpions.


Elemental Companion
Every druid reveres nature, but some pay more respect to the fundamental building blocks of the natural world than to its flora and fauna. By forgoing her bond with the animal kingdom, a druid can instead take on an elemental creature as her companion.

Class: Druid.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (the planes) 1 rank, Speak Language (Auran, Terran, Ignan, or Aquan).

Replaces: You do not gain an animal companion, nor do you gain wild empathy.

Benefit: You gain the companionship of a Small elemental (air, earth, fire, or water; your choice). You must speak the language of your chosen elemental companion (Auran, Terran, Ignan, or Aquan, respectively).

Your elemental companion has the normal statistics of an elemental of its kind. It does not gain any extra HD, natural armor adjustment, Strength or Dexterity adjustment, or extra tricks (it is intelligent enough to follow your spoken commands and thus needs no tricks). It gains all other special abilities normally granted to an animal companion, with the exception of Multiattack.

At 4th level, your elemental grows into a Medium elemental of the same kind. Its statistics change appropriately.

At 10th level, you can choose for your elemental companion to grow to a Large elemental of the same kind, with the appropriate changes to its statistics. If you choose for your elemental to remain Medium, it instead gains 2 HD, +2 Strength, +2 Constitution, and damage reduction 5/-.

At 16th level, you can choose for your elemental companion to grow to a Huge elemental of the same kind, with the appropriate changes to its statistics. If you choose for your elemental to remain at its current size, it instead gains an additional +4 HD, +4 Strength, +4 Constitution, and damage reduction 5/-. All these benefits stack with existing statistics except for the damage reduction.

Fangshields Druid
Druids of the Fangshields are the healers and nurturers of the group, acting on behalf of their more monstrous allies who cannot interact with "civilized" humanoids without causing fear and panic.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Fangshields druid substitution level, a character must be a nonhumanoid creature, be a member of the Fangshields, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 4th, 5th, or 7th level of druid.

Class Skills
Fangshields druid substitution levels have the class skills of the standard druid class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.


Table: Fangshields Druid Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
4th	+3	+4	+1	+4	Spontaneous curing	Same as druid
5th	+3	+4	+1	+4	Wild shape (hands, 1/day)	Same as druid
7th	+5	+5	+2	+5	Wild shape (humanoid)	Same as druid
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Fangshields druid substitution levels.

Spontaneous Curing (Su): At 4th level, a Fangshields druid can spontaneously convert prepared druid spells of 1st level or higher into cure light wounds spells, just as a cleric can. Unlike a cleric, she cannot convert her prepared spells into any cure spell, just cure light wounds, nor can she apply metamagic feats to these spontaneously cast spells.

This benefit replaces the resist nature''s lure class ability gained by a standard druid at 4th level.

Wild Shape (Hands) (Su): At 5th level, a Fangshields druid can use her wild shape ability to create simple dexterous hands if she doesn''t have them already. For example, a giant eagle, lammasu, or unicorn could use wild shape to change her feet, paws, or hooves into hands that work as well as human hands. These hands lose any natural attacks they previously possessed, but otherwise still function like their original shape (a unicorn could walk or run at normal speed on her hoof-hands, for example). She can make this change whenever she uses her wild shape, even when she assumes another form. For example, a unicorn druid could take the form of a wolf with functional paw-hands.

This benefit is in addition to the standard druid''s wild shape ability.

Wild Shape (Humanoid) (Su): At 7th level, a Fangshields druid can use her wild shape ability to assume a Medium humanoid form. The humanoid form can resemble a human, dwarf, elf, or other Medium humanoid as the druid desires and has the appropriate racial traits for that race (according to the polymorph spell). This ability is typically used by a druid to interact with humanoid settlements without drawing too much attention to herself. However, the humanoid form retains some of a Fangshields druid''s original monstrous appearance, much like how a lycanthrope in hybrid form has humanoid and animal features, resulting in a -4 penalty on Disguise checks made to pass as a humanoid. The hybrid form can speak as well as a true humanoid, though the change of form does not give the druid knowledge of that form''s language (a druid in the form of an elf wouldn''t automatically know how to speak Elven, but could use her elf-mouth to speak any languages she did know).

For example, a giant eagle could wild shape into a humanlike humanoid, but she would resemble an eagle-human hybrid (much like an avoral guardinal); a treant taking the form of an elf hybrid would look like a tall elf with barklike skin and leaves in her hair (much like a dryad).

This benefit replaces the third use of wild shape per day gained by a standard druid at 8th level. From this point forward, a Fangshields druid has one less daily use of wild shape than normal.

Focused Animal
Those allied with nature are perhaps the hardest to distemper, but even druids can lose their faith. When a druid no longer reveres the entirety of nature, he sometimes learns to communicate with his closest ally: his animal companion.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain trackless step, wild shape, or woodland stride.

Benefit: You gain the effects of a continuous speak with animals spell, but you may only use it to speak with your animal companion. In addition, for the purpose of determining your animal companion''s bonus Hit Dice, natural armor adjustment, Strength and Dexterity adjustment, bonus tricks, and special abilities, you are treated as a druid two levels higher than you actually are. This does not allow you to gain a more powerful alternative animal companion at an earlier level.

Go to Ground
Just as most druids and scouts have an almost supernatural ability to avoid being tracked in the wild, so too have others learned to blend in so fully with the urban throng that nobody remembers their passage.

Class: Druid or scout.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain trackless step.

Benefit: When you choose to "lay low," you become all but impossible to find without magical means. All attempts to find you with Urban Tracking simply fail outright.

Golarion Druid
Due to the constant spread of civilization during the Age of Enthronement, many druids took to the mountains for solace. These druids adapted to the rocky terrain and have gained the above ability. This ability replaces woodland stride.

Mountain Stride (Ex): A druid with this ability can move through rocky terrain at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Magically manipulated terrain, such as spike stones, affects her normally.

Goliath Druid
The goliath race venerates nature in its various forms, and druids are the most prominent spellcasters, divine or otherwise, among goliath tribes. Goliath druids forge particularly strong bonds with the earth and stone of their environment, granting them and their animal companions unusual powers related to elemental earth.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a goliath druid substitution level, a character must be a goliath about to take her 1st, 6th, or 12th level of druid.

Class Skills
Goliath druid substitution levels have the class skills of the standard druid class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this quantity as a beginning character).

12th	+9/+4	+8	+4	+8	Wild shape (earth)	Same as druid
Class Features
All the following are features of the goliath druid''s racial substitution levels.

Elemental Bond (Ex): A goliath druid who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level forges a bond with the Elemental Plane of Earth, allowing her to summon more or more powerful earth creatures than normal.

When casting a summon nature''s ally spell to summon a creature with the earth subtype, the goliath druid may treat the spell as if it were the next higher-level version of that spell. This benefit allows her to summon a single more powerful creature than she might otherwise be able to summon, or more of the same type of creature that she could normally summon.

For example, a goliath druid who casts summon nature''s ally I could summon a single Small earth elemental (as if she had cast summon nature''s ally II). When casting summon nature''s ally V, the druid could summon one Huge earth elemental, one average xorn, 1d3 Large earth elementals, or 1d4+1 Medium earth elementals or minor xorns (as if she had cast summon monster VI). A goliath druid with this ability who casts summon nature''s ally IX can summon two elder earth elementals (instead of one).

A goliath druid who selects this substitution level permanently gives up her ability to summon creatures that have the air, fire, or water subtype.

Earth Companion (Ex): A goliath druid who takes the 6th-level racial substitution level can imbue her animal companion with the power of elemental earth. The animal companion''s Strength increases by 2, and its Dexterity is reduced by 2. Its natural armor bonus increases by 3. It gains a burrow speed of 10 feet (or, if it has a burrow speed, that speed increases by 10 feet). The companion gains the earth mastery extraordinary ability (+1 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls if both it and its foe touch the ground; if an opponent is airborne or waterborne, the earth companion takes a -4 penalty on attack rolls and damage rolls). It also gains damage reduction 5/magic as an extraordinary ability.

The companion''s type doesn''t change, but it gains the earth subtype.

If a goliath druid replaces her animal companion with a new one, she can apply this effect to the new companion, but only if the reduction in her effective druid level reduction would not make the new companion unavailable to her. The previous companion loses the special abilities when it leaves the druid.

For the purpose of determining her animal companion''s bonus Hit Dice, special abilities, and so on, the effective level of the goliath druid who selects this substitution level is reduced by three, per the Alternative Animal Companions table.

Wild Shape (Earth) (Su): A goliath druid who takes the 12th-level racial substitution level can use her wild shape ability to change into an earth elemental with the same size restriction as for animal forms. The druid''s maximum HD limit when taking earth elemental form (either with this ability or with her wild shape [elemental] ability gained at 16th level) is equal to her druid level +1.

This benefit replaces the standard druid''s 12th-level wild shape (plant) ability.

Half-Orc Druid
While most orcs revere their primary deity, Gruumsh, others are drawn to the primal brutality of nature. Half-orc druids are noted for their brute strength and force of will, summoning animals that are more powerful than normal and fighting with impressive physical prowess.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a half-orc druid substitution level, a character must be a half-orc about to take her 1st, 4th, or 6th level of druid.

Class Skills
Half-orc druid substitution levels have the class skills of the standard druid class, plus Intimidate.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.


Table: Half-Orc Druid Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+0	+2	+0	+2	Tough animal companion, nature sense, wild empathy	Same as druid
4th	+3	+4	+1	+4	Bully animal	Same as druid
6th	+4	+5	+2	+5	Augmented nature''s allies	Same as druid
Class Features
All the following are features of the half-orc druid racial substitution levels.

Tough Animal Companion (Ex): The half-orc druid tends to attract physically powerful specimens. Her animal companion gains Toughness as a bonus feat.

Bully Animal (Ex): Beginning at 4th level, when the half-orc druid uses her wild empathy ability, she adds her Strength modifier to the check instead of her Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces the standard druid''s resist nature''s lure ability.

Augmented Nature''s Allies (Su): Starting at 6th level, any animal summoned by a half-orc druid with a summon nature''s ally spell gains a +4 bonus to Strength and Constitution. These bonuses don''t stack with those granted by the Augment Summoning feat.

This benefit replaces the standard druid''s ability to use wild shape one additional time per day. From this point on, the half-orc druid''s number of daily wild shapes is reduced by one (2/day at 7th level, 3/day at 10th level, and so on).

Halfling Druid
The halfling druid often follows a more pragmatic approach in exploring his link to the natural world. He gives up some of his innate ability to summon allies, while strengthening his bond with his animal companion (which is commonly used as a mount by the otherwise slow-moving halfling). His expanded skill selection allows him to serve as a capable scout.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a halfling druid substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take his 1st, 5th, or 13th level of druid.

Class Skills.
Halfling druid substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard druid class, plus Climb, Hide, Jump, and Move Silently.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort

Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+0	+2	+0	+2	Animal companion, enhanced link, nature sense, spontaneous casting, wild empathy	Same as druid

13th	+9/+4	+8	+4	+8	Camouflage	Same as druid
Class Features
All the following are features of the halfling druid''s racial substitution levels.

Spontaneous Casting: Halfling druids often use their animal companions as mounts, and they have developed a method of enhancing their animal companions'' mobility and defenses by channeling their own spell energy.

A halfling druid can channel stored spell energy into specific spells that he hasn''t prepared ahead of time. He can "lose" a prepared spell to cast any spell from the following list of the same level or lower, but he may only target himself or his animal companion with the spell (if it has a target). For example, a halfling druid who has prepared call lightning (a 3rd-level spell) may lose call lightning to cast protection from energy, spider climb, or jump, but may only target himself or his animal companion with the spell. (A halfling druid''s ability to share spells with his animal companion works normally with these spells.)

1st: jump

2nd: spider climb

3rd: protection from energy

4th: freedom of movement

5th: tree stride

6th: summon nature''s ally VI

7th: summon nature''s ally VII

8th: summon nature''s ally VIII

9th: summon nature''s ally IX

This substitution feature replaces the standard druid''s ability of spontaneous casting.

Enhanced Link (Ex): In addition to the normal benefits gained by the druid''s link to his animal companion, a halfling druid gains a +4 circumstance bonus on all Ride checks made in conjunction with his animal companion. He takes no penalty for riding his animal companion without a saddle.

In addition, as long as the halfling druid rides his animal companion, his animal companion shares the druid''s woodland stride and trackless step class features (assuming the druid has these class features).

This substitution feature augments, but does not replace, the standard druid''s link class feature.

Undersized Wild Shape (Su): A halfling druid''s Small size limits his wild shape ability (including his elemental wild shape and any other wild shape options he gains from feats or other special abilities), reducing them by one size category. However, he can use his wild shape ability one additional time per day (2/day at 5th level, 3/day at 6th, 4/day at 7th, and so forth).

At 5th level, a halfling druid gains the ability to turn himself into any Tiny or Small animal. He gains wild shape (Medium) at 8th level, wild shape (Diminutive) at 11th level, and wild shape (Large) at 15th level.

At 16th level, he gains the ability to use wild shape to transform into a Tiny, Small, or Medium elemental; he can transform into a Large elemental at 20th level.

This class feature is otherwise identical to the standard druid''s wild shape ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druid''s wild shape ability.

Camouflage (Ex): A halfling druid of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn''t grant cover or concealment.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druid''s a thousand faces class feature.

Huntsman
The druid might choose to give up her wild shape ability in exchange for becoming a swift and deadly hunter.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Armor and shield proficiency, wild shape (all versions).

Gain: Bonus to Armor Class when unarmored (as monk, including Wisdom bonus to AC), fast movement (as monk), favored enemy (as ranger), swift tracker (as ranger), Track feat (as ranger).

Iron Constitution
Natives to the worst and filthiest areas of the city have to contend with stenches and illnesses of a sort rarely found in the wild, yet some have become so inured that they are all but immune.

Class: Druid.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain resist nature''s lure.

Benefit: The druid gains Strong Stomach (Cityscape 64) as a bonus feat, even if she does not meet the prerequisites. If she already has this feat, she may instead choose any feat for which she does meet the prerequisites.

In addition, the druid gains a +2 bonus on saves against disease.

Metal Master
If stone forms the bones of the world, then assuredly metal makes for the land''s marrow. It colors cave walls and forms ingots in shallow streams, but it otherwise lacks the presence and power of the more obvious elements of nature. Yet when harvested and shaped for a purpose, few materials have strength enough to resist it. This quality of metal forms the core of the metal master''s philosophy.

Metal masters are anomalous among druids. They forsake their connection to animals and the elements to focus on an aspect of the natural world that druids must deny themselves. They respect the potential of raw ore to become something greater, and devote themselves to mastering that process in themselves. Metal masters believe all creatures of the world have a like ability, both to be formed and form themselves, and in a world filled with so many potential tools and weapons, metal masters would be the forgers.

Metal masters see the world as a great foundry. Creatures are either smiths themselves or pig iron to be formed and used by others. This outlook causes many metal masters to be manipulative and dismissive with those who do not shown drive or impress with their actions. Evil metal masters exemplify this outlook, while lawful metal masters tend to be less dismissive but more controlling. Neutral metal masters care little for how other creatures forge their destinies and focus wholly on their own. Chaotic metal masters gleefully shape those around them without thought to the consequences. Good metal masters try to teach others about their own potential to change themselves into a force for good in the world.

Metal masters stay close to sources of metal, and many can be found wandering caves or living on the banks of gold-filled streams. Metal masters love mines, so long as the detritus of such operations are cared for properly. Metal masters also journey into civilized areas more often than any other kind of druid. They prefer to use urban smithies, saving the natural world from the smoke and wastes of the process, and they also use these visits to mold others in their vision or preach their philosophy of self-actualization.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The metal master''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (architecture and engineering) (Int), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the metal master.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Metal masters are proficient with all simple and martial melee weapons made primarily of metal. Metal masters are proficient with all armors and with shields (including tower shields).

Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook. A metal master follows the same spell progression as the druid.

Spontaneous Casting: A metal master can channel stored spell energy into druid spells that she hasn''t prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast one of these spells so long as it is of the same level or lower: chill metal, heat metal, rusting grasp, ironwood, transmute metal to wood, repel metal or stone.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Bonus Languages: A metal master''s bonus language options include Druidic, the secret language of druids. Metal masters are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids. Druidic has its own alphabet. This option is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

A metal master also knows Terran, the language of earth creatures, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level metal master. Terran is a free language for a metal master; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages, and it doesn''t lake up a language slot.

Mine Sense (Ex): At 1st level, the metal master gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (dungeoneering) and Knowledge (architecture and engineering) checks.

Metal Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, the metal master gains a +2 bonus on Craft (armorsmithing), Craft (blacksmithing), and Craft (weaponsmithing) checks.

Damage Reduction (Su): As a metal master forges a destiny and grows in power, her body makes a supernatural connection to the qualities of the metals in the earth. At 6th level, the metal master gains damage reduction 1/bludgeoning, her body becoming inured to all strikes but the blows that fall like hammers on anvils. This damage reduction improves as shown in the metal master advancement chart until at 16th level, the metal master loses her bludgeoning damage reduction and gains damage reduction 5/cold iron, silver, or adamantine. At this point, the metal master suffers less damage from all blows except those made from the metals that are the true blood and bones of the earth. At 18th level, this damage reduction improves as shown in the metal master advancement chart, until at 20th level, the metal master has damage reduction 5/adamantine, reducing the damage of attacks from all but the hardest metal.

Major Creation (Sp): At 11th level, the metal master can cast major creation as a caster of a level equal to her metal master level once per day. The metal master can only create objects made of metal with this spell.

Timeless Body (Ex): After attaining 15th level, a metal master no longer takes ability score penalties for aging (see Table: Aging Effects) and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the metal master still dies of old age when her time is up.

Iron Body (Sp): At 19th level, the metal master can cast iron body as a caster of a level equal to her metal master level once per day.

Phynxkin Companion
A druid or ranger who adventures in regions rich with draconic influence can gain an alternative animal companion, a phynxkin, that serves him as loyally as any other animal companion would.

Class: Druid or ranger.

Level: 1st (druid) or 4th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you give up your standard choice of animal companion, and your animal companion does not gain all benefits normally accorded to it (see below).

Benefit: You gain a phynxkin as an animal companion. Treat it as an animal for the purpose of determining the effects of your skills, feats, spells, and other abilities.

When your phynxkin would normally gain the devotion special quality, both you and the phynxkin instead gain immunity to fear effects, but only while you are within 30 feet of each other.

When your effective druid level for determining your animal companion''s abilities reaches 7th, you can replace your animal companion with a dire phynxkin animal companion. Doing this reduces your effective druid level for determining its abilities by six.

Planar Druid
The forces of nature, both subtle and grand, are manifestations of a deeper reality, where cosmic spheres revolve about each other in an awesome celestial dance. That dance generates the energy behind the fury of a storm, the brilliant sun, and even the vitality of life. The druid who understands the ecological connections between the seen and unseen is more capable, more knowledgeable, and more tuned into the events that move in all realms of existence.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a druid planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 4th, 9th, or 13th level of druid.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Druid planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard druid class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

13th	+9/+4	+8	+4	+8	Counter summoning	Same as druid
Class Features
All of the following are features of the druid''s planar substitution levels.

Resist Extraplanar Might (Ex): A 4th-level druid who selects this planar substitution benefit gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of outsiders.

This benefit replaces the resist nature''s lure class feature gained by a standard druid at 4th level.

Planar Tolerance (Ex): A planar druid of 9th level or higher becomes attuned to the nature of the planes she visits and gains immunity to their natural planar effects. Any effect that would be negated by the planar tolerance spell is negated by this druid ability. Unlike the spell, this ability affects only the druid herself.

This benefit replaces the immunity to venom class feature gained by a standard druid at 9th level.

Counter Summoning (Su): Some druids who walk the planes come to believe that excessive summoning of extraplanar creatures constitutes an abuse of the planes themselves, and they learn to deal with this problem at the source. A planar druid of 13th level or higher can ready a standard action to counter a summon monster spell or any spell-like ability that summons an extraplanar creature. This ability functions exactly as a counterspell using dispel magic, except that the druid need not cast a spell to make the attempt. The druid must make a caster level check against a DC of 11 + the opponent''s caster level (if the opponent does not have a caster level for its summoning ability, use its Hit Dice instead). Success indicates that the spell or spell-like ability is countered.

This benefit replaces the a thousand faces class feature gained by a standard druid at 13th level.

Plant Companion
Druids and rangers both attune themselves to the rhythms of the natural world, connecting to the vast web of life and calling upon special assistants. While usually drawn from the ranks of the animal kingdom, a few connect more with plants instead. Pouring a tiny portion of their life force into saplings or brambles, they rouse those that sleep, giving plants mobility and a measure of free will.

A plant companion improves in much the same manner as an animal companion, using the Table: The Druid''s Animal Companion when determing such things as bonus Hit Dice and natural Armor Class adjustment. All plant companions begin play using the following statistics. When using Handle Animal to get a plant companion to perform a trick, its master does not suffer the normal -5 penalty incurred when dealing with creatures of types other than animal.

NATURAL SELECTION
As you gain levels in druid or ranger, you can call upon more powerful animal companions whose abilities advance more slowly. Instead of a more powerful plant companion, though, you gain the ability to evolve the one you have, endowing it with new abilities. This requires a ritual that lasts 24 hours. Each new ability has a delay in levels between when you select it and when your plant companion gains it. You may select a new ability for your plant companion at any druid or ranger level in which a previously selected ability does not manifest. Your plant companion can only evolve one new ability at a time. For example, if at last level you choose to give your plant companion the bioluminescent ability, it gains that ability when you attain 2nd level. The most common plant companion special abilities follow.

Abilities marked with an asterisk may be taken more than once. Their bonuses or increases stack.

Alacrity (Ex): Your plant companion may, as part of a full attack action, make a bonus melee attack using its highest attack bonus. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Bioluminescent (Ex): Your plant companion glows in the dark, creating a non-magical illumination equal to a torch. It may suppress or reactivate this light as a standard action. Your plarit companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Blindsight (Ex): Your plant companion gains blindsight with a range of 30 feet. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Blunting Mold (Ex): Your plant companion develops a thick, cloying fungus along its length that automatically coats any slashing or piercing weapon that damages it. This mold causes the weapon to deal half damage on all aftacks until its wielder spends 1 standard action wiping it off. Your plant companion gains this ability after 3 levels.

Bonus Feat (Ex): Your plant companion gains a bonus feat. It must meet all of the feat''s prerequisites. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Cactus Spurs (Ex): Your plant companion grows numerous wickedly sharp barbs along its length. Any creature that grapples it or attacks it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon takes 1d3 points of piercing damage. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Darkvision (Ex): Your plant companion gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Distracting Pollen (Ex): Your plant companion may, as a standard action, emit a cloud of red dust in a 10-foot radius centered on itself. All creatures within the red dust have partial concealment granting a 20% miss chance. This dust disperses after 1d4 rounds. Your plant companion can use this ability at will, but it must wait 5 rounds between each use. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Eldritch Fibers (Ex): Attacks your plant companion makes with its natural weapons are treated as magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Growth Spurt (Ex): Your plant cOmpanion increases to Large size. You must select Powerful at least twice prior to taking Growth Spurt. Your plant companion gains this ability after 3 levels.

Ironbark* (Ex): Your plant companion''s natural armor increases by +3. Yon must select Powerful at least once prior to taking Ironbark. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Mirrored Bark* (Ex): Your plant companion develops a highly refractive surface, granting it a +2 bonus to Armor Class versus rays and a +2 bonus on Reflex saving throws made to resist spells or spell-like effects. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Oakenbough* (Ex): Your plant companion''s Strength score and Constitution score increase by +2. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Poisonous (Ex): All attacks by your plant companion deliver a mild poison (injury; DC 10 + half the plant''s HD + the plant''s Constitution modifier; Initial and secondary damage 1d3 Dex). Your plant companion gains this ability after 3 levels.

Powerful* (Ex): Your plant companion gains +1 Hit Die. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Roots (Ex): Your plant companion gains fast healing 1. Your plant companion gains this ability after 3 levels.

Scent (Ex): Your plant companion gains the scent ability. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Spines (Ex): Your plant companion can make ranged attacks (it can make as many ranged attacks in a round as it can normally make melee attacks) by firing tiny spines. It can either make melee attacks in a round or fire its spines; it cannot mix its attack types in a round. These spine attacks deal 1d3 points of piercing damage + half its Strength modifier, with a range increment 30 feet. Any additional effects that affect your plant companion''s melee attacks (such as delivering poison) also affect its ranged attacks. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Sticky Sap (Ex): Your plant oozes a strong adhesive that might trap any melee weapon that damages it. When such an attack hits, the wielder must immediately make an opposed Strength check against your plant companion (your plant companion gains a +4 racial bonus on this check). If your plant companion succeeds, the weapon becomes stuck. You can pull the weapon free as a move action, but any other creature (including the weapon''s owner) must use a standard action (that provokes attacks of opportunity) and succeed at an opposed Strength check. If the attacker succeeds he can pull his weapon free. Your plant companion gains this ability after 5 levels.

Swift* (Ex): Your plant companion''s speed increases by 10 feet. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Tendrils (Ex): Your plant companion''s reach doubles. Your plant companion gains this ability after 2 levels.

Thorns* (Ex): Your plant companion deals +1 point of damage with each attack and now deals only piercing damage. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

Tremorsense (Ex): Your plant companion gains tremorsense with a range of of 60 feet. Your plant companion gains this ability after 1 level.

* You may endow your plant companion with this ability multiple times. Its effects stack.

Root Walker
You are a child of the underworld. While other druids dwell in lush forests and rolling fields, you tend to the mushroom tangles and lichen beds that lie beneath their feet.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain any of the following abilities: wild empathy at 1st level, woodland stride at 2nd level, and resist nature''s lure at 4th level.

Benefit: At 1st level, you gain vermin empathy. This ability functions just like wild empathy (PH 35) except that you can improve the attitude of vermin instead of animals, even though vermin are usually nonintelligent.

At 2nd level, you gain the ability to move over stone, rock, and earthen debris at your full speed without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. This ability functions only with natural surfaces. Magically altered surfaces, such as those created by soften earth and stone or spike stones, affect you normally.

At 4th level, you gain resistance to the powers of creatures most abhorrent to nature. You gain a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of aberrations.


Shapeshift
Taking the shapeshift alternative class feature means you can focus on your actions in combat (rather than worrying about your animal companion) while still unleashing nature''s fury upon your foes.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain an animal companion at 1st level, nor do you gain the wild shape class feature at 5th level (or any variation of that class feature at later levels, such as the ability to wild shape into an elemental at 16th level).

Benefit: You can shapeshift at will into powerful animal or nature-oriented forms. Each time you use this ability, you can choose the exact look that your shapeshifted form takes. Druids pick animals from the terrain and climate they''re most familiar with. For example, a druid from a jungle might adopt the form of a black panther when in predator form, while one from the taiga might shapeshift into a white wolf. The two forms look different, but functionally they''re identical. This is a supernatural ability.

It requires only a swift action to shapeshift. If you are capable of taking more than one form, you can shapeshift directly between two forms without returning to your normal form. There''s no limit to the number of times per day you can change forms, nor to the amount of time you can spend in a shapeshifted form.

You retain your normal Hit Dice, hit points, base attack bonus, base saving throw bonuses, and skill ranks regardless of your form. You also retain your normal ability scores, though each form grants a bonus to your Strength score.

You keep all extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like special attacks and qualities of your normal form, except for those requiring a body part your new form does not have.

All your held, carried, or worn gear melds into your new form and becomes nonfunctional until you return to your normal form. You cannot speak in shapeshifted form, and your limbs lack the precision required to wield a weapon or perform tasks requiring fine manipulation. You can''t cast spells or activate magic items while in shapeshifted form, even if you have the Natural Spell feat or other ability that would allow you to cast spells while wild shaped.

Unless otherwise noted in the descriptions below, you retain your size and space when you adopt a new form. You always retain your type and subtypes, regardless of the nature of the form assumed. You don''t gain any special attacks or qualities while shapeshifted except as described below.

When you shapeshift into a form other than your own, you gain natural weapons (and reach with those weapons) as described below. These natural weapons gain an enhancement bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls equal to 1/4 your druid level, and at 4th level and higher they are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The damage dice given are for Medium druids; smaller or larger druids should adjust those values according to the Table: Increased Damage By Size.

If knocked unconscious or slain in shapeshifted form, you revert to your original form.

Predator Form: This form, traditionally that of a wolf, panther, or other predatory mammal, is the first one a shapeshifting druid learns.

While in predator form, you gain a primary bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. You have the reach of a long creature of your size (5 feet for Small or Medium). You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength, and your natural armor bonus improves by 4. Your base land speed becomes 50 feet.

At 4th level, you gain Mobility as a bonus feat whenever you are in predator form (even if you don''t meet the prerequisites).

Aerial Form: At 5th level, you can shapeshift into a flying creature. Traditionally resembling an eagle, vulture, or bat, the aerial form enables fast travel and the ability to soar out of harm''s way.

While in aerial form, you gain a primary talon attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. You have the reach of a long creature of your size (5 feet for Small or Medium). You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Strength and a +2 enhancement bonus on Reflex saves, and your natural armor bonus improves by 2. You gain a fly speed of 40 feet (good maneuverability).

At 7th level, you gain Flyby Attack as a bonus feat whenever you are in aerial form.

Ferocious Slayer Form: At 8th level, you can shapeshift into a large and fierce predatory form, such as a tiger, brown bear, or dire wolf.

While in ferocious slayer form, you gain a primary bite attack that deals 1d8 points of damage and two secondary claw attacks that each deal 1d6 points of damage. Your size increases by one category (to a maximum of Colossal), and you have the reach of a long creature of your size (5 feet for Medium or Large). You gain a +8 enhancement bonus to Strength and a +4 enhancement bonus on Fortitude saves, and your natural armor bonus improves by 8. Your base land speed changes to 40 feet.

At 10th level, you gain Improved Critical (bite) and Improved Critical (claw) as bonus feats whenever you are in ferocious slayer form.

Forest Avenger Form: At 12th level, you can take the form of a massive plantlike creature, similar to a shambling mound or a treant. (Druids not native to forest terrains typically rename this form to fit their environment.)

While in forest avenger form, you gain a pair of primary slam attacks that deal 1d8 points of damage each. Your size increases by one category (to a maximum of Colossal) and you have the reach of a tall creature of your size (5 feet for Medium, 10 feet for Large). You gain a +12 enhancement bonus to Strength and a +4 enhancement bonus on Fortitude and Will saves, and your natural armor bonus improves by 12. Your base land speed becomes 20 feet.

You gain damage reduction 5/slashing while in forest avenger form.

At 14th level, you gain Improved Overrun as a bonus feat while in forest avenger form (even if you don''t meet the normal prerequisites).

Elemental Fury Form: At 16th level, you can shapeshift into a giant form of air, earth, fire, or water (your choice each time you shapeshift).

While in elemental fury form, you gain a pair of primary slam attacks that deal 2d6 points of damage each. Your size increases by two categories (to a maximum of Colossal), and you have the reach of a tall creature of your size (10 feet for Large, 15 feet for Huge). You gain a +16 enhancement bonus to Strength and a +4 enhancement bonus on Fortitude, Reflex, and Will saves, and your natural armor bonus improves by 16. You do not gain any new modes of movement in elemental fury form, nor does your base land speed change.

You gain immunity to extra damage from critical hits while in elemental form. You also gain immunity to an energy type related to the element chosen (air = electricity, earth = acid, fire = fire, water = cold). You don''t need to breathe while in elemental fury form.

At 18th level, you gain Great Cleave as a bonus feat while in elemental fury form (even if you don''t meet the normal prerequisites).


Shifter Druid
Beyond instinct, beyond even their empathic connection with nature, shifter druids hold a bestial spirit within their mutable forms. Their understanding of the natural world binds them closer to their lycanthrope heritage than other shifters, and from this bond is born a powerful relationship with an intangible spirit of raw and feral might. Shifter druids often cultivate a bond with these inner spirits rather than with an animal companion, greatly augmenting their spellcasting and shifting abilities.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a shifter druid substitution level, a character must be a shifter about to take his 1st, 4th, or 5th level of druid.

Class Skills
Shifter druid substitution levels have the class skills of the standard druid class, plus Balance, Climb, and Jump.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the shifter druid''s racial substitution levels.

Beast Spirit (Su): Shifter druids share a bond with a powerful internal spirit - an intangible manifestation of raw bestial strength and instinct. This spirit grows in power as a shifter druid advances in level, granting increased physical abilities, powerful augmentations to the shifter druid''s summoning, and additional spellcasting power. The beast spirit within a shifter druid is at once a separate entity and an extension of the shifter druid''s own lycanthrope heritage.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druid''s animal companion class feature. If the shifter gains an animal companion from another class (such as ranger), his druid levels don''t stack with levels of that other class to determine the animal companion''s abilities.

Reckless Nature (Ex): A shifter druid learns to rely on his animal instincts rather than his civilized qualities.

Beginning at 4th level, he gains a +2 insight bonus on initiative checks and Reflex saves, but takes a -2 penalty on Will saves.

This substitution feature replaces the standard druid''s resist nature''s lure ability.

Wild Shifting (Ex): A shifter druid learns to exercise extraordinary control over his own form, and beginning at 5th level, he can use his racial shifting ability one additional time per day. As well, he can use his Wisdom modifier (instead of his Constitution modifier) to determine the duration of his shifting.

A shifter druid who selects this substitution level also gains additional benefits at later levels. Beginning at 8th level, any natural weapons gained from shifting deal damage as if the druid were one size category larger than he is. At 15th level and higher, they deal damage as if he were two size categories larger (see Table: Increased Damage By Size).

This substitution feature replaces the standard druid''s wild shape ability, and at each level that a shifter druid would normally gain an additional daily use of wild shape, he instead gains one additional daily use of his shifting ability. The druid gains no abilities in place of wild shape (Tiny) or wild shape (plant), but gains the ability to wild shape into an elemental as normal from 16th level on (including additional uses at 18th and 20th level, and Huge size at 20th level).

THE SHIFTER DRUID''S BEAST SPIRIT
A shifter druid''s beast spirit is not a creature in the traditional sense, but neither is it subject to effects that affect some spirits (it can''t be cast out from the druid as a possessing ghost can, for example). Its presence grants the shifter druid the following abilities.

Class
Level	Ability
Bonus	Special
1st-2nd	+0	Alertness, extend shifting, feral empathy
3rd-5th	+2	Will of the spirit
6th-8th	+2	Transfer spirit
9th-11th	+4	Prepare spell (3rd level or lower)
12th-14th	+4	Rapid summons
15th-17th	+6	Prepare spell (6th level or lower)
18th-20th	+6	Manifested spirit
Class Level: The character''s druid level.

Ability Bonus: The druid gains a bonus to his Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score, choosing which ability score is affected at the time he prepares spells each day. He can change the affected ability score at any point in the day, but doing so requires a full minute of concentration and provokes attacks of opportunity. If this concentration disrupted in any way, the bonus is lost until the druid successfully attempts the process again.

Alertness (Su): A shifter druid''s spirit beast grants him Alertness as a bonus feat.

Extend Shifting (Su): Born of wild instinct and natural power, a shifter druid''s spirit beast strengthens the druid''s racial shifting ability, adding 2 rounds to its duration.

Feral Empathy (Su): Filled with the raw power of his beast spirit, a shifter druid bonds with wild animals instinctively, gaining a +4 bonus on wild empathy checks and Handle Animal checks.

Will of the Spirit (Su): A shifter druid''s beast spirit helps him maintain control of his mind. Starting at 3rd level, if he fails his normal saving throw against an enchantment spell or effect, the shifter druid can attempt an additional save 1 round later at the same DC.

Transfer Spirit (Su): Starting at 6th level, a shifter druid can temporarily transfer his beast spirit to any animal within 30 feet that he has summoned with a summon nature''s ally spell. Transfer spirit is a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

While the spirit is transferred, all benefits it normally grants the druid are temporarily suppressed. In exchange, the summoned creature gains a bonus to its Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution score (whichever of the druid''s abilities was enhanced at the time of transfer) equal to twice the bonus gained by the druid. This ability also enables the druid to communicate with the summoned animal as if they shared a common language.

A shifter druid cannot recall his beast spirit until the summoned creature dies, is dismissed, or the summoning spell ends. Once transferred, the animal can move more than 30 feet away from the druid without losing the beast spirit benefits.

Prepare Spell (Su): The presence of his beast spirit allows a shifter druid to prepare one extra druid spell of 3rd level or lower to be cast on himself ( which must have a range of touch or personal). The spell is prepared normally and treated as if cast by the druid for all purposes (caster level, save DC, and so forth), but is cast by the beast spirit with a moment''s thought on the part of the shifter druid (a swift action). A beast spirit cannot cast this spell while it is transferred to another creature. The druid cannot lose a spell prepared in this manner in order to use his spontaneous casting ability.

Starting at 15th level, the druid can prepare and cast a spell of up to 6th level using this ability.

Rapid Summons (Su): The presence of his beast spirit enhances the druid''s connection to the otherworldly animals and natural creatures that he can summon using the summon nature''s ally spell. From 12th level on, as long as the beast spirit is present within the druid, he casts any summon nature''s ally spell as a standard action instead of a full-round action.

Manifested Spirit (Su): With his lycanthrope heritage strengthened by the presence of the beast spirit, a shifter druid manifests more powerful abilities when he shifts. At 18th level, the shifter druid gains Extra Shifter Trait as a bonus feat. If he already has the Extra Shifter Trait feat, he gains its benefit a second time and can choose a third shifter trait (an exception to the normal rule that you cannot gain the benefit of this feat twice).

Sidhe Scholar
Civilized nations have often long forgotten the ancient druidic traditions. These "civilized" people might have even intentionally done away with the tradition and its strange, oft-misunderstood, pagan rites. Those who later pursue this lost knowledge rely more upon crumbling written accounts rather than the wild''s natural calling. Scholars of these ancient ways who show enough promise become embraced and "adopted" by trickster fey, learning the old ways anew. Capricious and cruel as only the fey can be, these new druids might eventually discover why the druids of old were put to the sword. The sidhe (pronounced "shee") scholar is an erudite hero who has lost touch with the more mundane tasks of a traditional druid (such as normal care of flora and fauna) in exchange for sylvan power that might prove itself best left to the immortals that refined it. The fey who usually take these druids under their wings are not your average "fairies." They are not dryads or nixies, grigs or brownies. Instead, the fey who train sidhe scholars are the refined, aristocratic faeries of the Seelie and Unseelie courts. As sleek and dangerous as hunting cats, these fey are incomprehensible beings to whom a human''s life holds as much significance as a mayfly''s. The faeries of the courts regard humans who wish to learn from and worship them with amusement, approving of their reverent attitudes as appropriate behavior from such inferior beings. As such, they do aid their supplicants readily, but expect much praise and appreciation for their pains.

The sidhe scholar is a more educated character than the archetypical druid. She actually has more in common with wizards than any other character class. A sidhe scholar is not a wizard, though. Despite erudite tendencies, the sidhe scholar is still a divine supplicant: she gains her magical powers through hard work and study, but she cannot cast her spells or perform her other magical abilities based upon her own inner arcane spark like a wizard or even a sorcerer. Instead, like other druids, she must draw upon the powers of nature and the wild lands. In settings with themes of urbanization and turning away from the natural world, the traditions of the original druidic ways are likely lost and must be rediscovered. Hence, the sidhe scholar calls not upon the deities of nature or the raw energy of the wilds themselves, but upon the only beings who remember the old ways well enough to instruct her - the fey.

Like the druid, the sidhe scholar values Wisdom as her most important ability score; bonus spells, spell DCs, and Will save are all extremely important to this magic-oriented variant. Intelligence and Charisma share secondary importance. Ranks in different Knowledge skills and Diplomacy serve her well. Pursuing the forgotten rites of the old druids might be viewed as foolish at best and dangerous at worst, making it important to assuage the fears and superstitions of concerned locals. Dealings with the fey themselves also tend to go much smoother with a high Charisma.

The sidhe scholar is a variant druid. Unless otherwise noted, a sidhe scholar advances in the same manner as a druid (same base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of druid or sidhe scholar, she may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level druid twice.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Skills
In addition to the class skills of the standard druid, the sidhe scholar also has Knowledge (arcana) as a class skill.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the sidhe scholar.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The sidhe scholar is only proficient with simple weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields), regardless of material composition. The sidhe scholar embraces more of the civilized world than the typical druid, but as a whole spends less time in martial pursuits.

Intelligentsia (Ex): At 1st level, the sidhe scholar gains Skill Focus (Knowledge [nature]) as a bonus feat. The sidhe scholar spends a lot of time in research, and so has a larger knowledge base than most druids.

Wild One (Ex): The sidhe scholar''s animal companion is a little more powerful than a standard druid''s companion. Thanks to the favor of the fey, the sidhe scholar''s animal companion has a bit of sylvan blood in it. The companion is exceptionally fit, sleek, and graceful. The animal companion begins with +1 hit point per Hit Die, +2 Dexterity, and +2 Charisma. Unfortunately, this wild blood makes the animal especially suspicious of humanoids. The animal always has an initial attitude of "unfriendly" around humanoids who aren''t its master (to whom it is as loyal as any other animal companion), but other druids or rangers can increase the animal companion''s attitude to "neutral" using the wild empathy ability. In addition, the animal refuses to enter a humanoid settlement larger than a thorp. The animal does not leave the druid completely, however, and lurks on the outskirts of the settlement until the druid rejoins it in the wilds.

Blessing of the Fey (Su): At 2nd level, the fey first bestow their gifts upon their willing supplicant, granting a +2 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) and Survival checks.

Sylvan Gifts (Su): Beginning at 4th level, the fey visit the sidhe scholar every night in her dreams, imparting her with magical secrets. The sidhe scholar gains bonus spells as if her Wisdom score were 2 higher than it really is. This does not affect the DCs of her spells.

Otherworldly Shifting (Su): The sidhe scholar''s wild shape forms vary greatly in appearance. In her wild shape form (whatever it might be), the sidhe scholar appears alien and strangely beautiful. Her form''s pelt or plumage is brightly and unusually colored, with angular features, sharply pointed ears, and almond-shaped faintly glowing eyes adding to the form''s alien appearance. Even though she has a set number of forms she can take, her forms never appear the same way twice. Every time she uses her wild shape ability, her form has some new random element, although it always tends toward being slightly smaller and leaner than a typical example of the animal''s kind. In short, the sidhe scholar who has wild shaped rarely blends in with her form''s natural kin.

Dark Moon''s Secret (Su): Few fey are inherently evil, but even the most good-aligned sylvan creature possesses a wicked sense of humor, to say nothing of an inhuman mind and set of abilities. The sidhe scholar can only muster a pale imitation of a fey''s true abilities, and most fey find dark humor in watching the "foolish mortal" metaphorically stumble about in an attempt to mimic their innate magical powers. Some are so amused that they decide to add more kindling to the fire, bestowing alien powers upon the druid perhaps best left unknown. At 6th level, the sidhe scholar adds the Evil domain spell list to her druid spell list.

Sylvan Craft (Su): If a promising pupil, the sidhe scholar learns from her faerie tutors the arts of item creation. At 12th level, the sidhe scholar gains Craft Staff as a bonus feat. The staffs she creates are abstractly beautiful, asymmetrical, ornate, and utterly alien in appearance. In the heat of creation the sidhe scholar ignores all else, snatching only enough scraps of food and sleep to stay alive. This allows her to create a staff in half the normal amount of time.

Skilled City-Dweller
The various wilderness-oriented skills are valuable indeed, but make less sense - and may prove less useful - for an urban character.

Class: Any class that has one or more of the "skills replaced," as listed below, on its list of class skills.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the "skills replaced" as listed below.

Benefit: The skilled city-dweller gains one or more skills as class skills, at the expense of other skills. If she does not have the proper skill to lose, she cannot gain the skill it grants as an urban benefit.

Note that she need not swap out all these skills. A skilled city-dweller may pick and choose, but she cannot later change her mind.

Skill Replaced	Skill Gained
Handle Animal	Gather Information
Knowledge (nature)	Knowledge (local)
Survival	Sense Motive
Ride	Tumble

Spontaneous Affliction
Druids who give up their rapport with most wild creatures can call upon the assistance of nature''s smallest beings. Such characters punish those who would despoil the wilderness by infecting them with a mild illness.

Class: Druid.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into summon nature''s ally spells.

Benefit: You can transform the stored energy of a spell you have prepared and use it to weaken your enemies.

To use spontaneous affliction, you must spend a standard action and sacrifice a prepared spell. All humanoids within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your class level + your Cha modifier) or become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell sacrificed.

Spontaneous Rejuvenation
By selecting the spontaneous rejuvenation alternative class feature, you can provide the party with plenty of healing without trampling on the cleric''s role.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to spontaneously convert prepared spells into summon nature''s ally spells.

Benefit: You can transform the stored energy of a spell you have prepared to invigorate you and your allies.

To use spontaneous rejuvenation, you must spend a standard action and sacrifice a prepared spell. All allies within 30 feet of you (including yourself) gain fast healing for 3 rounds. The fast healing amount is equal to the spell''s level. For example, if you sacrifice remove disease, a 3rdlevel spell, each ally gains fast healing 3 for 3 rounds.

The fast healing granted by this class feature doesn''t stack with itself or with fast healing from other sources.

Storm Druid
Although druids usually share a common goal, one radical group of druids is unlike any other. While the majority of druids attract and befriend animals, these protectors of nature actually repel living creatures. Forming an exclusive and somewhat unpopular branch of the druid class, these druids adopt the unpredictable temperament of powerful storms.

The storm druid is a variant druid. Unless otherwise noted, a storm druid advances in the same manner as a regular druid (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of druid or storm druid, she may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level druid twice.

Storm druids are almost universally chaotic neutral.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the storm druid. A storm druid retains the druid''s spellcasting ability as well as nature sense (1st level), resist nature''s lure (4th level), venom immunity (9th level), a thousand faces (13th level), and timeless body (14th level). She loses all other druid class abilities, including wild shape and acquiring an animal companion.

Spontaneous Casting: Unlike typical druids, the storm druid does not channel stored spell energy into summon nature''s ally spells. Instead, she can "lose" a prepared spell (of equal or higher level) to cast a spell from the following list, provided she can cast spells of the appropriate level:

1st - obscuring mist;

2nd - gust of wind;

3rd - call lightning;

4th - air walk;

5th - call lightning storm;

6th - chain lightning;

7th - control weather;

8th - whirlwind;

9th - storm of vengeance.

Deafness Immunity (Su): At 1st level, the storm druid becomes totally immune to deafness, magical or otherwise.

Frightful Presence (Ex): A storm druid of 2nd level or higher can unsettle animals with her mere presence. The ability takes effect whenever the druid attacks or charges. Animals within a radius of 30 feet are subject to the effect if they have fewer HD than the druid.

A potentially affected animal that succeeds on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 druid level + druid''s Charisma modifier) remains immune to that druid''s frightful presence for 24 hours. On a failed save, the animal becomes shaken for 4d6 rounds. Animal companions and familiars of the storm druid''s allies ignore his frightful presence.

At 8th level, the storm druid''s frightful presence also affects magical beasts, fey, and vermin.

At 16th level, the storm druid''s frightful presence affects creatures of all types.

Thunder Strike (Su): Once per day, a storm druid of 2nd level or higher can discharge a powerful electrical jolt that also creates a thunderclap with a successful melee attack. The storm druid must declare her intent to use this ability before she makes her attack. If successful, she deals an additional 1d6 points of electricity damage and forces her opponent to make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 storm druid level + Constitution modifier) or become deafened for 3d6 rounds. A failed attack still consumes one use of this ability. The storm druid can use this ability once per day at 2nd level, and one additional time per day at 6th, 11th, 15th, and 20th level. This ability cannot be used more than once per round.

At 11th level, the electrical damage increases to 2d6.

At 15th level, the deafness caused by this ability is permanent.

At 20th level, the electrical damage increases to 4d6.

Wind Sense (Ex): As she gains experience, the storm druid learns to read air currents and instinctively reacts to slight shifts in the wind, such as those created by a moving object or spell effect. At 3rd level, she gains a +1 insight bonus on all Reflex saving throws. This bonus increases to +2 at 9th level and +3 at 15th level.

Electricity Resistance (Su): At 5th level, the storm druid gains resistance to electricity 5. This resistance increases by 5 for every 5 additional storm druid levels (resistance 10 at 10th level, 15 at 15th, and 20 at 20th).

Improved Initiative: At 12th level, the storm druid gains the Improved Initiative feat.

Totem Druid
Some druids come from tribes with strong ties to a single animal spirit, referred to as the tribe''s totem. The animal''s spirit guards the tribe and advises its elders and chieftains, and the tribesmen tend to have characteristics attributed to the animal. Druids that come from a totemic tradition are closely linked to their tribe''s totem animal.

The totem druid is a variant druid. Unless otherwise noted, a totem druid advances in the same manner as a druid (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of druid or totem druid, she may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level druid twice.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the storm druid.

Totem Animal: At 1st level, a totem druid must choose one of the following animals to bind his spirit to: ape, bear, eagle, horse, shark, snake, tiger, or wolf.

Totem Animal Companion (Ex): The totem druid can only choose her totem animal (or its dire form) as her animal companion. Her animal companion gains special abilities as if the totem druid was two levels higher. The totem druid counts as two levels higher for purposes of determining whether or not she can choose a dire animal as her alternative animal companion.

Totem Shape (Su): Totem shape uses the same rules as wild shape, although a druid can only take the form of her totem animal. She gains the ability to change into this shape once per day at 1st level.

Starting at 6th level, the totem druid can choose to take the dire form of her totem animal once per day. The dire form is in addition to her normal usage.

Beginning at 10th level, the totem druid can choose to change into a celestial or fiendish form of her totem animal. Good druids using the planar totem shape form gain the celestial template and evil druids gain the fiendish template. Neutral druids must choose which template to apply upon reaching 8th level and cannot change their choice after that.

At 16th level, the totem druid gains the ability to apply her planar template to her dire form.

Natural Spell: At 2nd level the totem druid gains Natural Spell as a bonus feat.

Totem Speech (Ex): Starting at 8th level, the totem druid can speak any language she knows while in animal form and she can speak with her totem animals as with the speak with animals spell.

Urban Companion
The fearsome animal companions who accompany some casters in the wild are indeed a boon in combat, but a hulking wolf or creeping tiger is out of place in an urban environment. Some characters believe that small and subtle is of greater value than massive and mighty.

Class: Druid or ranger.

Level: 1st (druid) or 4th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain an animal companion.

Benefit: The character gains the companionship of a smaller but far more intelligent creature than she otherwise would have. This is identical to the sorcerer''s ability to summon a familiar (PH 52), including all benefits granted and gained by the familiar, except as noted below. Her functional level for determining the abilities of the companion is equal to her druid level or one-half her ranger level.

She does not lose experience points if her urban companion is slain, and she requires only 24 hours to replace one who is lost.

Her urban companion has total hit points equal to 3/4 her own hit points, rather than half as per a familiar.

The urban companion gains the ability to speak with other animals of its kind when she has an effective master level of 1st, rather than 7th.

When she reaches an effective master level of 7th, she can speak with animals of her companion''s kind, as per speak with animals. This is a supernatural ability that functions constantly, and it requires only a free action to reactivate if somehow dispelled.

Urban Sense
Druids native to the sprawling city master a widely differing range of skills than their wilderness-based counterparts.

Class: Druid.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain nature sense.

Benefit: She gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (local) checks and Sense Motive checks.

Voice of the City
For some, the ability to make oneself understood in the midst of any culture is of far greater value than the ability to influence the beasts of the wild.

Class: Druid, ranger, or spirit shaman.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wild empathy.

Benefit: Through a combination of body language, tone, and expression, the voice of the city can make herself understood by those who do not speak her language, and she can interpret their meaning the same way. Simple concepts that can be conveyed in a few words (such as "Help!" or "Drop your weapon!") can be conveyed automatically. More complex concepts require her to make a roll: d20 + her class level + either her Wisdom modifier (if trying to understand someone else) or Charisma modifier (if trying to make someone else understand her). Roll each only once per conversation. If she fails, she cannot try to communicate with that specific individual via this ability until she has gained a level. (Thus, it is possible, if she succeeds in one roll but fails in the other, to hold a conversation where she can understand the other speaker but he cannot understand you, or vice-versa.)

The DC of the roll depends on creature type and how closely the individual''s language is related to any of her own. The ability works most effectively with other humanoids. In this case, if the individual''s language uses the same alphabet as any language she knows, the DC is 20. If it does not, the DC is 30. (See Speak Language, PH 82, for this information.)

The above DCs increase by 5 if the speaker is a fey, giant, or monstrous humanoid; they increase by 10 if the speaker is an elemental. If the other individual is of any other creature type, she cannot communicate via this ability.

If the speaker is deliberately trying to make himself understood, the voice of the city gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this roll. If she is attempting to interpret his speech from outside normal conversational distance (such as eavesdropping), she takes a -4 penalty on this roll.

In addition, she gains Speak Language as a class skill.


Wasteland Druid
Druids are common in the waste, experts at living in harmony with that harsh environment. Some druids seek to help their people survive and prosper through careful use of the waste''s resources, while others specialize in turning the already inhospitable climate against intruders. Wasteland druids select their animal companions from among those mentioned in the Wasteland Animal Companions sidebar. This variant druid gains all the class features of the standard druid, except as noted below.

Sandskimmer: At 2nd level, a wasteland druid gains Sand skimmer as a bonus feat. This benefit replaces the standard druid''s woodland stride class feature.

Heat Endurance: At 4th level, a wasteland druid gains Heat Endurance as a bonus feat. If she already has Heat Endurance, the druid gains Improved Heat Endurance instead and need not meet the prerequisites for that feat. This benefit replaces the standard druid''s resist nature''s lure class feature.

Wild Shape (Waste Vermin) (Su): Beginning at 10th level, a wasteland druid can use her wild shape ability to assume the form of a Small to Large vermin found in the waste environment, such as a brine swimmer, giant ant lion, giant termite, monstrous scorpion, or monstrous spider. This ability otherwise follows all the rules for wild shape, and the druid can assume additional larger sizes of vermin as her level increases.

This benefit replaces the standard druid''s increase fourth daily use of the wild shape ability gained at 10th level. From this point forward, the waste druid can use wild shape one less time per day than indicated on Table: The Druid.

Weapon Proficiencies
Traditionally, druids are thought of as forest-dwelling folk, an assumption reflected by their weapon proficiencies. However, what if your druid comes from a vast desert or from near a metropolitan area? The following lists provide alternative weapon proficiencies designed with such campaigns in mind. A character using an alternative weapon list is proficient with all weapons on the list instead of those in which druids commonly have proficiency.

AQUATIC/COASTAL
Druids from coastland or aquatic areas are more adept at using piercing weapons such as spears and tridents, as locals often use those tools for spearing fish and find them easier to wield underwater. Druids from coastland or aquatic areas are proficient with the club (often fashioned from driftwood), dagger, dart, longspear, net, quarterstaff, sling, spear, shortspear, and trident.

ARCTIC/TUNDRA
The frozen lands are brutal and unforgiving, and all but druids and most hearty of souls find themselves at odds with this environment''s harsh nature. Druids hailing from this region learn to use weapons that mimic the land''s deadly and unforgiving nature or those easily found or crafted in an environment miserlike with its raw materials. Arctic druids are proficient with the club, dagger, handaxe, light pick (those living in the arctic rely on ice picks when climbing hills or mountains), morningstar, quarterstaff, scythe, sickle, sling, spear, and throwing axe.

DESERT/WASTELAND
Wood, a scarce commodity in deserts and wastelands, rarely finds use in weapons used by druids hailing from such regions. As such, the desert druid lacks proficiency in many of the mainstays of druid weaponry (such as the club and quarterstaff). Because people living in the desert must adapt to severe conditions, desert druids learn to use several relatively exotic weapons. Desert druids are proficient in the falchion, javelin, kukri, scimitar, shortspear, sling, spear, and whip.

GRASSLAND/SAVANNAH
Grasslands and savannahs are vast, open spaces, harboring few places to hide when danger rears its head. Thus, druids who live in such areas learn to use more ranged weapons than traditional druids, allowing them to strike out at great distance. Druids of the grassland and savannah know how to use bolas, the javelin, longspear, scythe (long used as an implement for cutting grass and hay), shortbow, shortspear, sickle, sling, and spear.

MOUNTAIN
Druids from mountainous regions have a reputation for being more warlike and barbaric than their other brethren and thus are proficient with a more deadly array of weaponry. Some of their weapons double as tools used for mining. Many, if not most, dwarven druids can make use of this weapon proficiency list. Mountain druids have proficiency with the battleaxe, club, dagger, handaxe, heavy pick, light pick, quarterstaff, sling, and warhammer.

SUBTERRANEAN/UNDERDARK
Few subterranean inhabitants choose the druidic path, but those who do recognize nature''s splendor even in the deepest depths below the surface. Their weapon proficiencies reflect the often tight and confining quarters of subterranean regions. Subterranean druids have proficiency in the club, dagger, heavy pick, light pick (also useful for digging through earth and stone), shortspear, shortsword, sling, and whip.

Wild Reaper
Autumn is a time for harvest. The fruits of summer fall from the vine and collect to rot, bearing the seeds and becoming the food for the next generation. This is where death interjects in the cycle of life, making killing a means of rebirth. Wild reapers acknowledge this aspect of nature and love it for the vital force it is. With a dispassionate eye, the wild reaper sees the autumn of all creatures, and when a creature''s harvest time comes, a wild reaper is ready with scythe and spell.

Wild reapers walk beside death. To them, dying is a healthy and necessary part of life. Yet wild reapers know death has its time and place in the natural cycle, like autumn has its place in the order of the seasons. Harvesting life too early prevents the birth of the next generation and diminishes the strength and wisdom the elderly pass on.

Wild reapers often unnerve people due to their preoccupation with death. They always seem to be looking for signs of illness or weakness in others, watching with predatory glee for evidence that a creature''s harvest time has come. They keep company with beasts of a similar bent: carnivores and scavengers, nature''s murderers and undertakers. Evil wild reapers earn a bad reputation for their fellows as even the smallest handicap or injury is an excuse to "purify" a species. Neutral and lawful wild reapers take the long view, waiting for time to decide what lives must ebb so that new life can flow into the world. Good wild reapers judge for themselves what will make the world a better place and help the weak become strong and the foolish wise. Chaotic wild reapers encompass all these views, acting as whim takes them.

Wild reapers tend to stay in places where the evidence of death and the changes of the seasons are obvious. They favor temperate forests, but individuals can be found anywhere from marshes to mountains, wherever life and death flourish.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The wild reaper''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the wild reaper.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Wild reapers are proficient with the following weapons: club, battleaxe, dagger, dart, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, scythe, sickle, sling, and throwing axe. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (unarmed strike, claw, bite, and so forth), regardless of the forms they assume (see Wild Shape, below). Wild reapers are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A wild reaper may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel. See the ironwood spell description.) Wild reapers are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.

A wild reaper who wears metal armor or carries a metal shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook. A wild reaper follows the same spell progression as the druid.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Bonus Languages: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Animal Companion (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook except that the wild reaper''s animal companion must be a carnivorous or omnivorous animal that feeds on carrion.

Nature Sense (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Woodland Stride (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Spontaneous Casting: Starting at 3rd level, a wild reaper can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn''t prepared ahead of time. She can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature''s ally spell of the same level or lower. In addition, the wild reaper can substitute a prepared spell with soften earth and stone, warp wood, diminish plants, poison, blight, rusting grasp, transmute rock to mud, antilife shell, or finger of death so long as the spell chosen from this list is of equal or lower level than the spell being substituted.

Resist Nature''s Lure (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Wild Shape (Su): At 5th level, a wild reaper gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all carnivorous or omnivorous animals that feed on carrion. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per wild reaper level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn''t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the wild reaper is familiar with.

A wild reaper loses her ability to speak while in animal form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form.

A wild reaper can use this ability more times per day at 6th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level, as noted on the wild reaper advancement table. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 8th level, a Tiny animal at 11th level, and a Huge animal at 15th level. The new form''s Hit Dice can''t exceed the character''s wild reaper level.

Disease Immunity (Ex): At 9th level, a wild reaper gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural infections like mummy rot and lycanthropy.

Turn Undead (Su): Wild reapers despise undead as abominations outside the natural order. When a wild reaper reaches 12th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of two levels lower would. The wild reaper does not need a holy symbol to turn undead.

Resist Death''s Lure (Ex): Starting at 13th level, a wild reaper gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against level drain and death effects.

Fast Healing (Su): Starting at 16th level, a wild reaper resists the call of death before age should take her. She heals 1 hit point of damage per round. At 20th level this ability improves to fast healing 3.

Ability Damage Healing (Su): After attaining 17th level, a wild reaper resists weaknesses not caused by age. She heals 1 point of ability damage to all damaged ability scores each round so long as the wild reaper has at least point of Constitution. At 20th level this ability heals 2 points to all ability scores each round.

Timeless Body (Ex): After attaining 19th level, a wild reaper no longer takes ability score penalties for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties she may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the wild reaper still dies of old age when her time is up.

Wind Walker
Air fills voids, flowing into hungry lungs to give life to the newly born. Air passes soft lips to breathe words, granting creatures the ability to comprehend one another. The wind walker knows he cannot hope to master these, the air''s most subtle and powerful abilities, but he can gain power over its more brutal movements.

Wind walkers favor the element of air, and they relish the tornado as much as the breeze that tousles hair. Their love and devotion to the elemental force grants them control of gales and zephyrs. With a word and a gesture, the wind walker can call upon the air to slow his fall or bowl over a giant. Wind walkers long for the freedom of the open skies. They view all flying creatures as kindred spirits and call upon such creatures to accompany them as they follow the wind wherever it leads.

Wind walkers find it hard to abide stillness, both their own and that of the air. They are uncomfortable in enclosed spaces, and many are phobic of being underwater or buried alive. Evil and chaotic wind walkers take it upon themselves to show others the power of the least recognized element. Neutral and lawful wind walkers can often be found working with a group of flying creatures to protect them and serve their needs. Good wind walkers recognize that the air is an enigmatic and unpredictable force in the natural world, and they seek to ensure more good comes of it than ill.

Wind walkers are free spirits that tend to roam, allowing the concerns of more sedentary creatures to blow over them. They only become anchored to a place where they can experience many kinds of winds or when they see a threat to a community of flying creatures. For this reason, most wind walkers can be found in mountain ranges of all dimes, but adventurous wind walkers can be found anywhere the wind blows and many places it does not.

Hit Die: d8.

1 In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 1st- through 9th-level spells, a 14th-level wind walker gets an air domain spell for each spell level, starting at 1st. The "+1" in the entries on this table represents that spell. Air domain spells are in addition to any bonus spells the wind walker may receive for having a high Wisdom score.
Class Features
All of the following are class features of the wind walker.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Wind walkers are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, javelin, quarterstaff, scimitar, shortbow, composite shortbow, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (unarmed strike, slam, and so forth), regardless of the forms they assume (see Elemental Shape, below). Wind walkers are proficient with light armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. (A wind walker may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the ironwood spell so that it functions as though it were steel.) Wind walkers are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.

A wind walker who wears metal armor or carries a metal shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of his supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.

Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook. A wind walker follows the same spell progression as the druid.

Spontaneous Casting: A wind walker can channel stored spell energy into summoning or air spells that he hasn''t prepared ahead of time. He can "lose" a prepared spell in order to cast any summon nature''s ally spell or druid spell with the air descriptor, but the spell must be of the same level or lower. If used to cast a summon nature''s ally spell, the summoned ally must have the ability to fly.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Bonus Languages: A wind walker''s bonus language options include Druidic, the secret language of druids. Wind walkers are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids. Druidic has its own alphabet. This option is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of his race.

A wind walker also knows Auran, the language of air creatures, which he learns upon becoming a 1st-level wind walker. Auran is a free language for a wind walker; that is, he knows it in addition to his regular allotment of languages, and it doesn''t take up a language slot.

Aerial Companion (Ex): A wind walker may begin play with a flying animal companion selected from the following list: eagle, hawk, or owl. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the wind walker on his adventures as appropriate for its species.

A 1st-level wind walker''s aerial companion is completely typical for its kind except as noted in the The Druid''s Animal Companion section. As a wind walker advances in level, the animal''s power increases as shown on the table.

If a wind walker releases his companion from service, he may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer. This ceremony can also replace an aerial companion that has perished.

Like a druid''s ability to select an alternative animal companion, a wind walker may instead select an alternative aerial companion at higher levels. The wind walker applies the indicated adjustment to his wind walker level (in parentheses) for purposes of determining the companion''s characteristics and special abilities. A wind walker of 4th level or higher may instead select a dire bat or hippogriff (level -3). A 7th-level wind walker may choose a giant eagle, giant owl, or juvenile arrowhawk (level -6). A 10th-level wind walker may choose a griffon or adult arrowhawk (level -9). At 13th level, the wind walker may choose a dragonne (level -12). A 16th-level wind walker may choose an elder arrowhawk (level -15).

Aerial Empathy (Ex): A wind walker can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of a magical beast or animal with the air subtype or ability to fly. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check made to improve the attitude of a person. The wind walker rolls 1d20 and adds his wind walker level and Charisma modifier to the roll to determine the aerial empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals and magical beasts are usually unfriendly.

To use aerial empathy, the wind walker and target creature must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing a creature in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

Zephyr Spellcasting (Ex): A wind walker casts druid spells with the air descriptor as though his caster level were 1 level higher. In addition, a wind walker adds +1 to the DCs of all such spells he casts.

Air Mastery (Ex): Airborne creatures take a -1 penalty to attack and damage rolls against a wind walker of 4th level or higher.

Feather Fall (Sp): After attaining 2nd level, the wind walker can cast feather fall as a caster of a level equal to his wind walker level. The wind walker gains additional uses of this ability as shown in the wind walker level advancement table.

Whispering Wind (Sp): After attaining 3rd level, the wind walker can cast whispering wind as a caster of a level equal to his wind walker level. The wind walker gains additional uses of this ability as shown in the wind walker level advancement table.

Friend of the Winds (Su): At 6th-level, a wind walker counts as two size categories larger when determining the effects severe wind have on him. See Table: Wind Effects.

Fly (Sp): After attaining 7th level, the wind walker can cast fly as a caster of a level equal to his wind walker level. The wind walker gains additional uses of this ability as shown in the wind walker level advancement table.

Air Spell Immunity (Su): At 9th level, a wind walker is immune to spells with the air descriptor, as though the spell failed to penetrate spell resistance. The wind walker may suppress this immunity for a specific effect he wishes to benefit from, such as the wind walk spell, using a standard action. Reactivating the ability is also a standard action.

Air Domain: A 12th-level wind walker receives the granted powers of the Air domain. At 14th-level, the wind walker gains access to the domain spells of the Air domain just like a cleric; he may prepare and cast the domain spell listed for each level once a day so long as he is of a level high enough to cast spells of that level. A wind walker cannot use the spontaneous spellcasting ability with these spells.

Timeless Body (Ex): After attaining 15th level, a wind walker no longer takes ability score penalties for aging (see Table: Aging Effects) and cannot be magically aged. Any penalties he may have already incurred, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the wind walker still dies of old age when his time is up.

Elemental Shape (Su): At 16th level, a wind walker can take the form of a Small, Medium, or Large air elemental once per day. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per wind walker level, or until he changes back. Changing form (to elemental or back) is a standard action and doesn''t provoke an attack of opportunity. The new form''s Hit Dice can''t exceed the character''s wind walker level. The wind walker gains all the elemental''s extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities. He also gains the elemental''s feats for as long as he maintains the elemental shape, but he retains his own creature type (humanoid, in most cases).

At 18th level, a wind walker becomes able to assume elemental form twice per day, and at 20th level he can do so three times per day. At 20th level, a druid may use this elemental shape ability to change into a Huge elemental.

Winter Warden
In winter, the world sleeps. Blanketed with white and rimed to glistening, the land knows a peace like a kind and quiet death. Nature holds its breath through the season, anticipating the riotous and messy birth of spring with glacial patience. This is the winter warden''s time.

Like druids, winter wardens devote themselves to nurturing nature, but their affinity for the natural world takes peculiar form. Winter wardens champion frost, ice, and snow. They love the world most when cold winds float flurries through barren treetops, across dormant fields, and over white-capped waves. They view winter as a great testing time for every creature, a period of winnowing that culls the old, weak, ill, and foolish to make room for the young, strong, and wise. Winter makes the world a better place in this way, and winter wardens follow the season''s example.

Winter wardens tend to be quiet and watchful. They remain distant and aloof, even with long-time acquaintances. Neutral and lawful winter wardens can take this outlook to extremes, becoming inured to the suffering of others and uncaring about their plights. Chaotic or evil winter wardens often view themselves as blizzards, great tests that winter sends to ensure only the most hale or well prepared survive. Good winter wardens often seek to help other creatures ready themselves for hardships ahead, ensuring that the good as well as the healthy and the wise survive troubled times.

Winter wardens can be found in any cold locale, and many follow the winter season in its dance north and south of the equator. Particularly sedentary winter wardens live like many members of the standard druid class, choosing a particular natural area to call home and living there year round. Adventuresome winter wardens can be found anywhere, even places that never feel the delicious chill of their favorite season.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The winter warden''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Spellcraft (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the winter warden.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The winter warden has the same proficiencies and restrictions as the druid as described in the Player''s Handbook.

Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook. A winter warden follows the same spell progression as the druid.

Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Bonus Languages: This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Animal Companion (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Cold Casting (Ex): A winter warden casts all spells (including spell-like abilities) with the cold descriptor as though his caster level were 1 level higher. In addition, a winter warden adds +1 to the DCs of all such spells he casts.

Nature Sense (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Wild Empathy (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook except that the winter warden does not suffer the usual penalty when using this ability on a magical beast of the cold subtype.

Ray of Frost (Sp): At 2nd level, ray of frost is added to the winter warden''s spell list as a 0-level spell. He can prepare and cast the spell as part of his normal allotment of druid spells.

Drift Stride (Su): Starting at 3rd level, a winter warden can move across the top of snow and not step into it or be impeded in his progress over a snowy area, similar to the effects of a water walk spell. Snow enchanted or magically manipulated to impede movement still affects the winter warden.

Trackless Step (Ex): This class feature is the same as the druid class feature of the same name described in the Player''s Handbook.

Ice Stride (Su): Starting at 5th level, a winter warden can move across ice and not step onto it or be impeded in his progress over an icy area, similar to the effects of a water walk spell. He does not take two squares of movement to enter an icy area, and Balance. Tumble, or Climb DCs in the area are not increased for him. This ability does not protect the winter warden from the cold of the ice or the negative effects due to long contact. Ice enchanted or magically manipulated to impede movement still affects the winter warden.

Wild Shape (Su): At 6th level, a winter warden gains the ability to turn himself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. His options for new forms include any creature of the animal type. This ability functions like the polymorph spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per winter warden level, or until he changes back. Changing form (to animal or back) is a standard action and doesn''t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the winter warden is familiar with, usually a creature that exists in arctic climes.

A winter warden loses his ability to speak while in animal form because he is limited to the sounds that an untrained animal can make, but he can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as his new form.

A winter warden can use this ability more times per day as noted on the winter warden advancement table. In addition, he gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 10th level and a Huge animal at 16th level. The new form''s Hit Dice can''t exceed the character''s winter warden level.

Resistance to Cold (Ex): Starting at 9th level, a winter warden gains resistance to cold 5. This resistance increases as the winter warden gains levels, as shown on the winter warden advancement chart.

Wall of Ice (Sp): After 13th level, the winter warden can cast wall of ice as a caster of a level equal to his winter warden level once per day.

Otiluke''s Freezing Sphere (Sp): After 17th level, the winter warden can cast Otiluke''s freezing sphere as a caster of a level equal to his winter warden level once per day.

Immunity to Cold (Ex): Starting at 18th level, a winter warden is immune to cold damage.

Polar Ray (Sp): At 20th level, the winter warden can cast polar ray as a caster of a level equal to his winter warden level once per day.',

UPDATE classes 
SET 
    description = 'The questing knight, the conquering overlord, the king''s champion, the elite foot soldier, the hardened mercenary, and the bandit king - all are fighters. Fighters can be stalwart defenders of those in need, cruel marauders, or gutsy adventurers. Some are among the land''s best souls, willing to face death for the greater good. Others are among the worst, with no qualms about killing for private gain, or even for sport. Fighters who are not actively adventuring may be soldiers, guards, bodyguards, champions, or criminal enforcers. An adventuring fighter might call himself a warrior, a mercenary, a thug, or simply an adventurer.

Most fighters see adventures, raids, and dangerous missions as their job. Some have patrons who pay them regularly. Others prefer to live like prospectors, taking great risks in hopes of the big haul. Some fighters are more civic-minded and use their combat skills to protect endangered people who cannot defend themselves. Whatever their initial motivations, however, fighters often wind up living for the thrill of combat and adventure.

Of all classes, fighters have the best all-around fighting capabilities (hence the name). Fighters are familiar with all the standard weapons and armors. In addition to general fighting prowess, each fighter develops particular specialties of his own. A given fighter may be especially capable with certain weapons, another might be trained to execute specific fancy maneuvers. As fighters gain experience, they get more opportunities to develop their fighting skills. Thanks to their focus on combat maneuvers, they can master the most difficult ones relatively quickly.

Fighters may be of any alignment. Good fighters are often crusading types who seek out and fight evil. Lawful fighters may be champions who protect the land and its people. Chaotic fighters may be wandering mercenaries. Evil fighters tend to be bullies and petty villains who simply take what they want by brute force.

Fighters often worship Heironeous (god of valor), Kord (god of strength), St. Cuthbert (god of retribution), Hextor (god of tyranny), or Erythnul (god of slaughter). A fighter may style himself as a crusader in the service of his god, or he may just want someone to pray to before putting his life on the line yet another time.

Fighters come to their profession in many ways. Most have had formal training in a noble''s army or at least in the local militia. Some have trained in formal academies. Others are self-taught - unpolished but well tested. A fighter may have taken up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on the farm, or he may be following a proud family tradition. Fighters share no special identity. They do not see themselves as a group or brotherhood. Those who hail from a particular academy, mercenary company, or lord''s regiment, however, share a certain camaraderie.

Human fighters are usually veterans of some military service, typically from more mundane parents. Dwarf fighters are commonly former members of the well-trained strike teams that protect the underground dwarven kingdoms. They are typically members of warrior families that can trace their lineages back for millennia, and they may have rivalries or alliances with other dwarf fighters of a different lineage. Elf fighters are typically skilled with the longsword. They are proud of their ability at swordplay and eager to demonstrate or test it.

Half-orc fighters are often selftaught outcasts who have achieved enough skill to earn recognition and something akin to respect. Gnome and halfling fighters usually stay in their own communities as part of the area militia rather than adventuring. Half-elves are rarely fighters, but they may take up swordplay in honor of the elven tradition.

Among the brutal humanoids, few can manage the discipline it takes to be a true fighter. The militaristic hobgoblins, however, produce quite a number of strong and skilled fighters.

The fighter excels in a straight fight, but he relies on others for magical support, healing, and scouting. On a team, it is his job to man the front lines, protect the other party members, and bring the tough opponents down. Fighters might not understand the arcane ways of wizards or share the faith of clerics, but they recognize the value of teamwork.

In most adventuring parties, the fighter serves as a melee combatant, charging into the fray while his comrades support him with spells, ranged attacks, and other effects. Fighters who favor ranged combat can prove very deadly, though without other melee support, they can find themselves in front-line combat more often than they might prefer.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The fighter''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str).

Replaces: This benefit replaces one of your fighter bonus feats.

Benefit: As a free action, you can orient your weapon along one alignment component that you possess. For example, if you are chaotic good, you can make your weapon either chaotic- or good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This effect lasts until you choose to end it or change it (as a free action) to the other alignment component, or until you no longer wield the weapon.

Ammunition or a thrown weapon affected by this ability remains aligned until it either strikes a target or misses. Aligned strike is a supernatural ability.

Armor of God
Your belief protects you from attacks.

Level: 8th or any even-numbered higher level.

Replaces: This benefit replaces one of your fighter bonus feats.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can reduce your base Will save to +0 and gain a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the amount of the reduction. This effect lasts until the beginning of your next turn. Armor of god is a supernatural ability.

Armored Mage
Rare is the fighter who hasn''t envied the wizard''s bag of magical tricks. Although even the most basic arcane spell remains beyond a fighter''s abilities, those who aspire to such talents can, with practice, learn to cast simple arcane spells while wearing light armor. On its own, this alternative feature grants little benefit to a single-classed fighter; only in conjunction with one or more levels of sorcerer, wizard, or a similar arcane spellcasting class does this ability come into play.

Class: Fighter.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You lose proficiency with medium armor and heavy armor.

Benefit: Choose one arcane spellcasting class, such as sorcerer. You can avoid any chance of arcane spell failure for spells gained from this class as long as you restrict yourself to light armor and light shields. This training does not extend to any other form of armor or shields, nor does this ability apply to spells gained from other spellcasting classes.

This benefit applies only to spells of a level equal to or lower than your fighter class level + 1.

Armored Savant
You have a mystic connection to your armor.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 1st level.

Benefit: At 1st level, you show an inborn mastery for wearing bulky armors in such a way that they do not hinder you. You ignore the weight of your armor for the purpose of calculating encumbrance and your armor slows you as if it were one category lighter than it is (so medium armor does not slow you and heavy armor slows you as if it were medium armor). In addition, the maximum Dexterity bonus for any armor you wear improves by +1 and the arcane spell failure chance of any armor you wear is half normal. This is a supernatural ability.

Bodyguard
While anyone suspicious, alert, and tough enough can serve as a guard, the bodyguard is a warrior specifically trained to protect a charge. Bodyguards need to be just as adept in battle as any other fighter, but they cannot content themselves with that. In any situation, their first thought must be not how to defeat the enemy, but how to best protect their charge. They remain alert for ambushes, test food for poison, and identify liars and deceivers. Many bodyguards become skilled bargainers so that they can deal with situations that force of arms cannot solve.

Class Skills
The bodyguard''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Listen (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the bodyguard.

Bonus Feats: The bodyguard gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the bodyguard must select bonus feats from the following list: Alertness, Animal Affinity, Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Great Fortitude, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Initiative, Improved Shield Bash, Improved Trip, Investigator, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Negotiator, Persuasive, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Run, Spring Attack, Toughness, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

Special Abilities: The bodyguard can choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Cover: The bodyguard can give an adjacent creature the benefit of her shield bonus to Armor Class or the dodge bonus provided by use of the Combat Expertise feat, or both, as a free action. If the bodyguard wishes, she may give her shield bonus to one adjacent creature and her dodge bonus due to Combat Expertise to a different adjacent creature as a free action. When the bodyguard does this, she does not gain these benefits to her AC. If an adjacent creature gaining protection moves more than 5 feet from the bodyguard, it immediately loses the defensive bonus. The dodge bonus or shield bonus provided by the bodyguard stack with such bonuses the protected character already has.

Clear the Path: The bodyguard gains the Cleave and Great Cleave feats, but they only apply when the bodyguard fights defensively, uses the Combat Expertise feat, or gives her shield bonus to another creature by using the cover special ability.

Bonded Armor
You perform a powerful ritual to tie a particular suit of armor to you.

Level: 8th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 8th level.

Benefit: Starting at 8th level, you can form an eldritch bond with a specific suit of armor, providing you with greater protection. Bonding requires you to wear the same specific suit of heavy armor every day for at least 30 days (for at least 8 hours per day), followed by a 24-hour-long ritual involving 100 gp worth of incense and magical components. The act of bonding makes the armor a part of you, allowing you to don or remove it as full-round action. In addition, as long as you are awake and can move freely, the armor grants you a +1 insight bonus to your Armor Class. While worn, this bonus increases by an additional +1 at 14th and 20th levels (to +2 and +3, respectively). This is a supernatural ability.

Commander
Commanders are soldiers trained in recognizing and using other''s abilities in battle along with their own skill. These men and women can lead hordes and armies, take charge of a battalion of soldiers, or even direct a small group of elite troops, such as a party of adventurers.

Class Skills
The commander''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (architecture and engineering) (Int), Profession (siege engineer) (Wis), Ride (Dex), Sense Motive (Cha), and Spot (Wis).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the commander.

Bonus Feats: The commander gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the commander must select bonus feats from the following list: Alertness, Animal Affinity, Cleave, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Fortitude, Greater Weapon Focus, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Improved Shield Bash, Iron Will, Leadership, Mobility, Mounted Combat, Negotiator, Persuasive, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Spring Attack, Toughness, Trample, Weapon Focus, Whirlwind Attack.

Special Abilities: The commander can choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Helpful Hints: By standing back and surveying a fight, the commander can shout quick directions to his comrades, pointing out openings and incoming attacks. This allows the commander to use the aid another action from up to 60 feet away, giving an ally in melee combat with an opponent a +2 bonus to her next attack roll against that opponent or a +2 bonus to AC for the next attack against her that opponent makes, so long as the attack comes before the commander''s next turn. The commander must use a standard action and successfully make an attack roll against AC to as normal. In addition, the ally must be able to hear and understand the commander.

Rousing Speech: Whether it''s before the battle or in the midst of it, commanders have a way of delivering stirring speeches that inspire those who stand with them. As a full-round action that does not provoke an attack of opportunity, the commander can give such a speech to his companions, providing allies within 60 feet with a +1 morale bonus to attacks for 1 round. The commander must succeed at a Diplomacy check (DC 15). The effects of his speech last 1 additional round for each point by which the commander''s roll exceeds the DC. The commander may use this ability once per day for every two commander class levels he has; he cannot take this ability until 2nd level.

Corsair
The corsair is a marine warrior as deadly with her blade as any landlubber soldier and twice as dangerous in her home territory - the shifting decks of a ship. She scorns heavy armor for fear of drowning, but that only forces her to be more skillful, cagey, and dangerous. Prettier pirates might charm their victims into giving over riches; the corsair takes plunder by might.

Class Skills
The corsair''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Jump (Str), Profession (sailor) (Wis), Use Rope (Dex), Spot (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the corsair.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The corsair is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, with light armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Bonus Feats: The corsair gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the corsair must select bonus feats from the following list: Acrobatic, Agile, Athletic, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved Trip, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Unarmed Strike, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Skill Focus (any class skill), Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

Special Abilities: The corsair gains one of the following special abilities for free at 1st and 2nd level and may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Climb-Fighting: The corsair becomes so used to fighting in the rigging of a ship that she is no longer considered flat-footed when climbing.

Rope Movement: The corsair may use the Use Rope skill in place of Tumble when trying to move through threatened areas, provided there is rigging, rope, vine, or something else from which she can swing. Like with Tumble, 5 or more ranks in Jump grant a +2 synergy bonus to Use Rope checks made to tumble past foes.

Slow Fall: Whenever the corsair is within reach of a sail, tapestry, or similar item, she may use it to slow her fall provided she has a bladed weapon in her hand, driving the blade through the cloth and riding it down. A corsair with this ability could also use a rope or pole to slow her fall provided it can fit in her hand. When using this ability, the corsair treats the fall as 30 feet shorter than its actual distance for purposes of calculating damage. The corsair may take this ability multiple times, and the distance stacks each time, but the corsair can only slow her fall for the length of the cloth or rope. The corsair can additionally use the Jump and Tumble skills to treat the fall as a shorter distance if she wishes.

Swinging Bull Rush: Grabbing a rope and swinging hard, the corsair plants both heels into an opponent, sending him stumbling back. If the corsair can swing from something while making a bull rush attack, she can use the momentum to her benefit. For every 5 feet swung in the attack, add +1 to the opposed Strength check. If the corsair wins the opposed check, she forces the opponent back an additional 5 feet; the corsair does not need to move with the opponent for these 5 feet. This attack still provokes an attack of opportunity unless the corsair has the Improved Bull Rush feat.

Big Breath: The corsair learns to control her need for air. When she must start making Constitution checks to avoid drowning, the corsair only needs to make the check every other round. The check still increases by one each time, but because a check is made every other round, it increases at half the normal rate.

Ocean Tangle: When grappling underwater, the corsair''s expertise in swimming grants her mobility denied to other creatures. Whenever the corsair is in water deep enough to swim in, she can use a Swim check instead of a grapple check in any opposed grapple check.


Counterattack
Every offensive move creates an opening for a counterattack, and you know how to exploit this facet of combat to its fullest.

Level: 12th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 12th level.

Benefit: At 12th level, you learn to hold back some of your offensive prowess to enable a potent counterattack. As a full-round action, make one melee attack at your highest base attack bonus. At any time before the start of your next turn, you can use an immediate action to make a melee attack (using your highest base attack bonus) against an enemy that attacks you in melee.

Darksong Knight
The Darksong Knights are elite soldiers of Eilistraee who further her many causes and hunt the yochlol, the demonic servants of the Spider Queen. They develop an intricate, dancelike style of swordplay and special powers to defeat their demonic enemies.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Darksong Knight substitution level, a character must have Eilistraee as her patron deity, be a member of the Darksong Knights, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 2nd, 6th, or 8th level of fighter.

Class Skills
Darksong Knight substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class plus Perform (dance).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.


Table: Darksong Knight Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
2nd	+2	+3	+0	+0	Bonus feat, dancing feint
6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Bonus feat, favored enemy (yochlols +2)
8th	+8/+3	+6	+2	+2	Bonus feat, combat dancing
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Darksong Knight substitution levels.

Bonus Feat: A Darksong Knight''s choice of bonus feats is identical to a standard fighter''s bonus feats.

Dancing Feint (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a Darksong Knight can use her Perform (dance) skill to feint in combat as if it were the Bluff skill.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 4th level, a Darksong Knight gains yochlols as a favored enemy, just as if she were a 1st-level ranger. Unlike standard ranger favored enemies, which are classified by monster type, the Knight''s favored enemy bonuses apply only to yochlols, not all kinds of demons.

Combat Dancing (Ex): At 8th level, a Darksong Knight with at least 5 ranks in Perform (dance) gains a +2 dodge bonus against attacks of opportunity. If she uses Spring Attack, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus on the attack roll made as part of the maneuver.

Dead Levels
The fighter, with nine dead levels (one at every odd level), has one of the most logical progressions of special abilities. They gain a bonus feat every two levels if you imagine the first bonus feat to be granted during a conceptual "0" level for apprentices. As an option-based class, their dead level abilities also incorporate a degree of choice in keeping with the overall fighter level design.

Physical Prowess (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a fighter gets a bonus to some aspect of his ability checks that makes him a better warrior. The fighter gains an additional bonus at 5th level and every two fighter levels thereafter (7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th). The bonus must be drawn from the following list.

Applied Force (Ex): A fighter can administer force to the weakest points of inanimate objects effectively, giving the character a +1 bonus on Strength checks to break or burst items (see Breaking Items).

Combat Bearing (Ex): A fighter can steady himself to fight in precarious situations, giving the character a +1 bonus on Dexterity checks to avoid falling when damaged while balancing or moving quickly across difficult surfaces (see Balance).

Stamina Reserve (Ex): A fighter can push his body more than normal, giving the character a +1 bonus on Constitution checks to continue running and to avoid nonlethal damage from a forced march.

Dirty Fighter
Some fighters prefer stealth and cunning over martial skill. This variant can also be combined with the thug variant

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Bonus feats.

Gain: Sneak attack (as rogue).

Dragonscale Husk
Any warrior knows that skill in battle isn''t enough; you must also guard against the attacks of your enemies. A well-forged suit of armor can mean the difference between life and death, but a warrior whose very body is his armor has an immediate advantage. Those who have the blood of dragons running in their veins can gain this benefit.

Class: Any standard class that grants proficiency in heavy armor, such as fighter or paladin.

Level: 1st (unless the class grants proficiency in heavy armor at a level other than 1st, in which case this feature can be taken only at that level).

Special Requirement: You must be of the dragonblood subtype to select this alternative class feature. As long as you gain the dragonblood subtype at the same level that you would gain heavy armor proficiency, you can select this class feature, even if you would normally choose class features before selecting the option that grants you the subtype. For example, a 1st-level human fighter who takes Dragontouched as one of his 1st-level feats could also select this class feature.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain proficiency with any kind of armor. If you would later gain some form of armor proficiency (such as by multiclassing or taking a feat), you can choose at that time to gain that profi ciency, but you then lose this class feature. If you already have proficiency with any kind of armor, you must lose that proficiency in order to select this class feature.

Benefit: You gain the extraordinary ability to grow a thick, scaly hide that protects you like armor. The dragonscale husk resembles the scales of a dragon of your choice (selected when you gain the class feature). The husk requires 8 hours to grow, but this process can take place at night while you are sleeping.

Your scaled hide grants you a bonus to your Armor Class equal to 6 + 1/3 your class level in the class that granted you heavy armor proficiency (+7 bonus to AC at 3rd level, +8 bonus to AC at 6th level, and so on, up to a maximum +12 bonus to AC at 18th level). Multiple classes that grant this proficiency stack for determining the dragonscale husk''s total bonus. This bonus doesn''t stack with any feat, racial trait, or other special ability that would grant you a bonus to Armor Class.

In addition, as you attain higher levels, your husk grants you increasing resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. You gain resistance 5 at 5th level, resistance 10 at 10th level, resistance 15 at 15th level, and resistance 20 at 20th level.

Your dragonscale husk is treated as medium armor for the purpose of determining your speed and whether you can use class features or other special abilities. It allows a maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class of +2 and has an armor check penalty of -4. You can sleep in your husk without penalty. You cannot wear any other armor while your husk is present.

Your husk isn''t treated as armor for the purpose of being affected by spells or other abilities. You can''t grant it an enhancement bonus with magic vestment, nor can you imbue it with special properties, as you could a normal suit of armor.

You can''t take off your dragonscale husk, but you can choose to shed it. Doing this requires 10 minutes of concentration and results in your sloughing off a pile of scales that crumble to dust if handled.

Drow Fighter
Drow fighters strike fast and melt away before their opponents have a chance to mount a counterattack. Rather than using heavy armor or picking feats that emphasize direct assaults, drow fighters employ techniques that exploit their natural advantages.

In exchange for a fighter''s access to heavy armor, a drow fighter gains strong first-strike capability.
Hit-and-Run Tactics
The drow specialize in guerrilla warfare, picking off their foes with poisoned bolts and slipping away into the darkness. Each attack wears their opponents down, until their numbers are so reduced that the drow can sweep in and capture them. If you select the hit-and-run tactics class feature, you sacrifice some AC, but make up for the loss with improved reflexes and accuracy when attacking unsuspecting foes.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: By selecting the hit-and-run alternative class feature, you give up proficiency with heavy armor and tower shields, even if you already have those proficiencies from another class. You can''t gain either of these proficiencies by multiclassing later, but you can gain them by selecting the appropriate feats.

Benefit: At 1st level, you gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks.

In addition, when attacking a flat-footed opponent within 30 feet, you can add your Dexterity bonus (if any) as a competence bonus on weapon damage rolls.

Dungeon Crasher
Survival in a dungeon requires more than skill at arms and a stout shield. Traps, hazards, falling portcullises, and other threats can pose as much danger as an enraged troll. But you cannot help your impetuous nature. When others might move ahead cautiously and search for traps and other hidden dangers, you charge forward, ignoring the traps you set off and splintering doors and obstacles.

Level: 2nd.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feats at 2nd level and at 6th level.

Benefit: You excel at overwhelming traps, smashing through doors, and pushing aside your enemies. At 2nd level, you gain a +2 competence bonus on saves and to your Armor Class when attacked by traps. You also gain a +5 bonus on Strength checks to break a door, wall, or similar obstacle.

In addition, you gain a special benefit when making a bull rush. If you force an opponent to move into a wall or other solid object, he stops as normal. However, your momentum crushes him against it, dealing an amount of bludgeoning damage equal to 4d6 points + twice your Strength bonus (if any).

At 6th level, the bonuses when dealing with traps increase to +4, and the bonus on Strength checks to break objects increases to +10. The damage you deal when bull rushing an opponent into a wall increases to 8d6 points + three times your Strength bonus.

Dwarf Fighter
The prototypical image of dwarfhood is the heavily armored fighter. Many dwarves pursue this class, and most multiclass dwarves have at least a single level of fighter to augment their abilities.

The dwarf fighter gives up versatility to specialize in the arts of war most needed in dwarf communities. He focuses on traditional fighting styles and takes advantage of the dwarf''s lack of mobility.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements
To take a dwarf fighter substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 8th level of fighter.

Class Skills
Dwarf fighter substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class plus Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Dwarf Fighter Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Axe focus
2nd	+2	+3	+0	+0	Racial foes
8th	+8/+3	+6	+2	+2	Heavy armor expertise
Class Features
All the following are features of the dwarf fighter''s racial substitution levels.

Axe Focus (Ex): A dwarf fighter who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level focuses his combat talents on axefi ghting. He gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the following weapons: battleaxe, dwarven waraxe, greataxe, handaxe, throwing axe, and the axe head of a dwarven urgrosh. (At the DM''s option, this bonus might also apply to other axe-related weapons.)

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but it is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for the purpose of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and anything else that requires that feat. For example, a dwarf fighter with this ability could take Weapon Specialization (battleaxe) without selecting Weapon Focus (battleaxe) as a separate feat.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 1st-level fighter.

Racial Foes (Ex): A dwarf fighter who takes the 2nd-level racial substitution level specializes in battling his race''s common enemies. He gains a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against orcs, goblinoids, and giants.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 2nd-level fighter.

Heavy Armor Expertise (Ex): A dwarf fighter who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level becomes as one with his heavy armor. When wearing heavy armor, he gains a +1 bonus to his AC.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 8th-level fighter.

Eldritch Grace
You can sense the subtle warping of reality caused by magic.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 4th level.

Benefit: Starting at 4th level, eldritch insight allows you to move with preternatural grace. You gain evasion against spells and magical effects as long as you are unencumbered or lightly encumbered. This is a supernatural ability.

Eldritch Juggernaut
Heavy armor you wear protects you from more than just physical attacks.

Level: 18th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 18th level.

Benefit: Beginning at 18th level, while wearing medium or heavy armor you gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your Hit Dice. This is a supernatural effect that does not stack with any other spell resistance you have.

Elusive Attack
You know that the key to winning any fight is not getting hit, so you trade offensive power for a steadier defense.

Level: 6th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 6th level.

Benefit: At 6th level, you master a technique of combining offense and defense. As a full-round action, make one attack at your highest base attack bonus. Until the start of your next turn, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to AC. This bonus improves to +4 at 11th level and to +6 at 16th level.

Exoticist
Some fighters train so they can seek adventure. Others turn their training into an adventure. Exoticists forgo training in traditional, mundane weapons and focus solely on the rare and bizarre. They rely not only on their ability to wield these weapons, but on their opponent''s inability to counter them.

Class Skills
The exoticist''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the exoticist.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The exoticist is proficient in the use of simple weapons, all armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields (including tower shields). The exoticist also gains proficiency with four exotic weapons at 1st level.

Bonus Feats: The exoticist gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the exoticist must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to an exotic weapon that the exoticist is proficient with): Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Far Shot, Great Cleave, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Initiative, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Sunder, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Lightning Reflexes, Manyshot, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Quick Draw, Rapid Reload, Rapid Shot, Shot on the Run, Spring Attack, Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

Special Abilities: The exoticist may choose any of the following in place of a bonus feat. To use any of the abilities described below, the exoticist must wield an exotic weapon with which she is proficient.

Dazzling Display: By making a flamboyant display of her weapon, the exoticist hides attack maneuvers, suddenly lashing out with an unexpected blow. The exoticist gains a +4 bonus to Bluff checks to feint in combat.

Exotic Attack: The exoticist not only learns to wield strange weapons, but to wield them strangely, and this unusual technique is more difficult to counter. The exoticist gains a +2 bonus to opposed trip attempts she initiates using her exotic weapon and opposed disarm rolls.

Strange Strike: The exoticist learns to fully exploit her knowledge of exotic fighting styles. She gains a +1 competence bonus to all attack rolls if her opponent is not proficient with the weapon the exoticist wields.

Fencer
Some fight for riches, others for the love of combat. The fencer fights for pride and personal honor. He is a refined warrior trained in a specialized style of combat steeped in ritual and rule, for only a proper fight will satisfy his honor. Some call him a dandy or a fop, but few would dare say so to his face. He might stink of expensive perfume and lack the calluses of labor on his hands, but his sword is as sharp as any grizzled mercenary''s, and his life of luxury only leaves him more time to train - as the foolish learn the hard way.

Class Skills
The fencer''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Ride (Dex), and Tumble (Dex).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the fencer.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The fencer is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, with light armor, and with the buckler.

Bonus Feats: The fencer gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the fencer must select bonus feats from the following list: Acrobatic, Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Initiative, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Persuasive, Quick Draw, Shield Proficiency, Skill Focus (any class skill), Spring Attack, Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

Special Abilities: Starting at 4th level, the fencer may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Encouraging Blow: Whenever the fencer scores a threat against an opponent, regardless of whether it becomes a successful critical, he gains a +3 morale bonus to his Armor Class against that foe''s attacks for a number of rounds equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum of 1). If the threat becomes a critical, double the morale bonus. This ability does not work against creatures with an Intelligence score lower than 3 or those immune to mind-influencing effects.

Denigrating Banter: The fencer''s method of fighting assaults his opponent''s self-confidence and pride. Taunts and jibes are as integral to his methods as feints and thrusts. However, an accomplished fencer can do more than insult his opponent: he can add great weight to his superior air, cowing others. As a standard action, the fencer may bait and taunt a foe. The fencer and the target creature make an opposed Charisma check. If the target creature fails to equal the fencer''s Charisma check, its base attack bonus is penalized by -2. This penalty increases by one for every 5 points by which the creature failed to equal the fencer''s Charisma check. If the target''s base attack bonus slips below the minimum required for any feat, special ability, or prestige class she possesses, she loses use of it until her base attack bonus again meets the requirement. A target whose base attack falls below what is needed to make multiple attacks with a full attack loses the appropriate number of attacks. This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to the fencer''s Charisma bonus plus 1 (minimum of 1). The effects of multiple denigrating banter attempts do not stack. This is a language-dependant, sonic, mind-affecting effect. Creatures who cannot understand or hear the fencer are immune. A fencer may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma bonus.

Insurmountable Counter: With a quick read of his opponent, the fencer identifies one of his foe''s techniques and assumes a fighting posture that nullifies it. When attacked by a foe using Power Attack or Combat Expertise, the fencer gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC.

Fortification
The armor you wear protects you in more ways than in just avoiding harm.

Level: 10th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feats at 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.

Benefit: Beginning at 10th level, when you wear heavy armor there is a 25% chance that any critical hit or sneak attack scored against you is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. The negation chance increases to 75% at 14th level and 100% at 18th level. This is a supernatural effect that does not stack with any other fortification you have.

Golarion Fighter
Numerous martial academies around the Inner Sea region teach weapon skill, tactics, diplomacy, and other tools useful for war. Fighters who attend these schools may choose the above option, which replaces the bonus feat gained upon taking the first level of fighter.

Class Skills: A fighter trained at a famous war college or fighting school gains the following class skills (in addition to the normal fighter class skills): Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Knowledge (architecture and engineering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (4 + Int modifier) × 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Half-Elf Fighter
Lacking the bonus feat of humans and the high Dexterity of elves, half-elf fighters are not particularly common. Those who do take up a life of the blade often become talkative swashbucklers who blend quick swordplay with a sharp tongue. They seek to confuse and demoralize foes, rather than overcoming them with brute force.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a half-elf fighter substitution level, a character must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 6th level of fighter.

Class Skills
Half-elf fighter substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class, plus Bluff, Diplomacy, and Sense Motive.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Half-Elf Fighter Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Blade focus
2nd	+2	+3	+0	+0	Main-gauche
6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Confusing banter
Class Features
All the following are features of the half-elf fighter racial substitution levels.

Blade Focus (Ex): The half-elf fighter focuses his combat talents on fighting with slender blades. At 1st level, the half-elf fighter gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the longsword and rapier.

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for the purposes of qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and so on that require the feat. For example a half-elf fighter with this ability could take Weapon Specialization (rapier) without selecting Weapon Focus (rapier) as a separate feat.

This benefit replaces the standard fighter''s 1st-level bonus feat.

Main-Gauche (Ex): At 2nd level, the half-elf fighter learns how to fight using a dagger in his off-hand in defense as well as offense. The half-elf fighter is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat when wielding a longsword or rapier in one hand and a dagger in his other hand. In addition, the half-elf fighter gains a +1 bonus to AC during any round that fights defensively while wielding weapons in this manner.

This bonus is treated as the equivalent of Two-Weapon Fighting for the purposes of qualifying for feats and prestige classes that require the feat.

This benefit replaces the standard fighter''s 2nd-level bonus feat.

Confusing Banter (Ex): The 6th-level half-elf fighter combines defensive tactics with a stream of wordplay aimed at tricking his opponent into letting his guard down. Whenever a half-elf fighter fights defensively, he may attempt a Bluff or Diplomacy check as a free action, opposed by his opponent''s Sense Motive check (the opponent may also add his base attack bonus on this check). If the half-elf fighter wins, he gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls against that creature until the end of his next turn. This ability only functions against creatures with Intelligence scores of 3 or higher. It is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability.

This benefit replaces the standard fighter''s 6th-level bonus feat.

Horseman
Horsemen trade encumbering armor for enhanced mobility and swap a single devastating lance charge for a series of punishing ride-by attacks. Rather than run roughshod over the front lines, these warriors weave their way through the ranks and leave trails of corpses behind them.

Class Skills
The horseman''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Jump (Str), Ride (Dex), and Tumble (Dex).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the horseman.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The horseman is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, light armor, and shields (except tower shields).

Bonus Feats: The horseman gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the horseman must select bonus feats from the following list: Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Cleave, Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Cleave, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Mounted Archery, Mounted Combat, Power Attack, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Trample, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

Special Abilities: The horseman may choose any of the following special abilities instead of a bonus feat.

Quick Turn: When making a charge on a mount, the horseman may make a number of turns, each not more than 90 degrees, equal to the mount''s Dexterity modifier. To do this, the horseman must succeed at a Ride check (DC 15) at each turn or the charge becomes a double move and the mount cannot attack.

Share Shield: The horseman may share his shield bonus with his mount as a move action by making a successful Ride check (DC 15).

Spur: The horseman can urge his mount to greater speeds, adding 10 feet to the mount''s base speed for one round. A mount can be spurred a number of times per day equal to its Constitution bonus.

Steady Hand: The horseman develops such a sense of trust with his mount that he can help it overcome its primal fears and foreign influences. Any time the mount must succeed at a Will save to overcome a mind-influencing effect, the horseman may make a Ride check (DC 10 + spell DC). If successful, treat the roll as a successful Will save for the mount.

Janissary
Created circa 1330 CE, the conscripted troops of the Ottoman army, called janissaries, operated under the system of devshirme (dev-shuhr-MEH). In this system, children of subjects (most often Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians) were taken from their families, raised as warriors, and indoctrinated into the culture and religion of those they served. Subject to strict rules and limited freedoms, the fierce and loyal janissaries held the highest moral standards and often practiced celibacy to enhance martial focus. Musically inclined, their heavy, intimidating tunes accompanied them into combat.

The emperor Murad I created the janissaries to replace the empire''s fragmented tribal army with a loyal force. However, the group''s power to influence events and defend their own interests led to a virtual state within a state and the eventual involvement of the janissary corps in coups against the empire.

Janissaries are usually lawful and most often neutral, but their order accepts all alignments.

Janissaries worship the deities of those they serve and often recognize their mortal lords as divine inhabitants of the Material Plane. The indoctrination of devshirme overcomes any racial differences between a janissary and its master. A human janissary could serve a half-orc without question and vice versa.

Learned and skilled in arts beyond those martial, janissaries know more of the world than most other fighters and speak of such things as architecture and historical events - often doing so in strange tongues.

Feats appropriate to janissaries include Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Improved Disarm, Improved Sunder (janissaries often sunder weapons and shields or attempt to disarm their foes with their first attacks), and some of the new feats from Heroes of Battle (such as Veteran Knowledge). Pious good-aligned janissaries sometimes take exalted feats, especially Vow of Chastity and Vow of Obedience. In addition, janissaries have developed certain methods for which they have become famous, as modeled by the feat Combat Engineer.

Fiercely loyal, janissaries possess a single-mindedness in combat rightly feared by their opponents. They tend to forgo heavy armor for greater stealth and speed, while preferring heavy blades like the greatsword.

The janissary is a variant fighter. Unless otherwise noted, a janissary advances in the same manner as a fighter (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of fighter or janissary, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level fighter twice.

Class Skills
A janissary gains Speak Language and two Knowledge skills (of his choice) as class skills, but Handle Animal, Intimidate, and Swim become cross-class skills for him.

Kensai
Instead of investing their time in learning how to wield all manner of weapons, some warriors spend all of their time training with a single melee weapon and become masters of it almost from the start of their adventuring careers. These warriors are known as kensai. Although the word literally means "sword saint," a kensai can devote herself to any weapon she chooses. There are kensai of axes, maces, even flails and spiked chains. What defines the kensai is the single-minded devotion to a particular weapon, not the weapon itself.

Class Skills
The kensai''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Jump (Str), Tumble (Dex), and Swim (Str).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the kensai.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The kensai is proficient in the use of all simple weapons, light armor, and a single martial or exotic melee weapon that is the kensai''s chosen weapon.

Bonus Feats: The kensai does not gain a bonus feat at 1st level like the normal fighter class does. Instead. the kensai gains a +1 bonus to all attack and damage rolls with her chosen weapon. This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and increases by +1 again every five levels thereafter.

The kensai gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the kensai must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to the kensai''s chosen weapon): Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Dodge, Great Cleave, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Sunder, Improved-Two Weapon Fighting, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Power Attack, Quick Draw, Spring Attack, Two-Weapon Defense, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

Special Abilities: The kensai can choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat. These abilities only apply to the kensai''s chosen weapon.

Rain of Blows: When taking the full attack action with her chosen weapon, the kensai can choose to suffer a -3 penalty to all attack rolls in the round and make an additional melee attack with her chosen weapon at her highest attack bonus.

Storm of Blows: When taking the full attack action with her chosen weapon, the kensai can suffer a -6 penalty to all attack rolls in the round and make two additional melee attacks with her chosen weapon at her highest attack bonus. The kensai must have the rain of blows special ability to take this ability.

Knight
Knights, both good and bad, are the masters of mounted combat and command, and the elite of noble soldiers. Only after many years of menial tasks, such as tending to the horses, taking care of the weapons and armor, and fixing meals, all occasionally broken up with lessons from a master, does a squire graduate to knighthood. Those without the perseverance to complete the apprenticeship never earn the title "Sir."

Class Skills
The knight''s class skills (and the key abil-ity for each skill) are Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Jump (Str), and Ride (Dex).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the knight.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The knight is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, all armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields (except tower shields).

Bonus Feats: The knight gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the knight must select bonus feats from the following list: Athletic, Combat Reflexes, Cleave, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Overrun. Improved Sunder, Mobility, Mounted Combat, Negotiator, Power Attack, Ride-By Attack, Spirited Charge, Toughness, Trample, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

Special Abilities: The knight may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Hard Charge: When a knight makes a mounted charge, both the knight''s and the mount''s attacks gain a +2 bonus to damage so long as the mount has moved a distance equal to or greater than its speed.

Jousting Charge: If the knight has a heavy or light shield readied when making a mounted charge, he does not suffer a -2 penalty to his Armor Class (but his mount still does).

Staggered Gait: If the knight successfully overruns an opponent using the Trample feat, his mount may take a -2 penalty to all its attack rolls for the round in order to gain a second hoof attack against the tripped opponent. The knight must have the Trample feat to take this ability.

Vicious Mount: The knight works with his mount to make it especially potent when it attacks. The mount''s attacks gain a +1 bonus to damage when the knight is riding the mount.

Kobold Fighter
Kobold fighters train to master the use of the spear, the traditional weapon of kobolds. They forego learning how to use some armor in exchange for learning to dodge attacks. Kobold fighters exercise arduously throughout their careers, striving to overcome some of the physical deficiencies they inherit as kobolds.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a kobold fighter substitution level, a character must be a kobold about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 4th level of fighter.

Class Skills
Kobold fighter substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class, plus Profession (miner) and Search.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Kobold Fighter Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Dodge, spear focus
2nd	+2	+3	+0	+0	Constitution boost (Con +2)
4th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Strength boost (Str +2)
Class Features
All the following are class features of the kobold fighter racial substitution levels.

Spear Focus (Ex): A 1st-level kobold fighter focuses his combat talents on spear fighting. He gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with the following weapons: longspear, shortspear, and spear. At the DM''s option, this bonus might also apply to other spearlike weapons.

This bonus does not stack with the bonus from Weapon Focus, but it is treated as the equivalent of Weapon Focus for qualifying for feats, prestige classes, and anything else that requires that feat. A kobold fighter who has this ability could take Weapon Specialization (spear) without selecting Weapon Focus (spear) as a separate feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter''s 1st-level bonus feat and medium armor proficiency.

Dodge (Ex): A kobold fighter who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains Dodge as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter''s heavy armor proficiency.

Constitution Boost (Ex): At 2nd level, a kobold fighter increases his Constitution score by 2 points.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter''s bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

Strength Boost (Ex): A kobold fighter who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level increases his Strength score by 2 points.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter''s bonus feat gained at 4th level.

Overpowering Attack
You never waste time wounding your opponent, instead concentrating on delivering one solid strike.

Level: 16th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the fighter bonus feat at 16th level.

Benefit: At 16th level, you can focus your attention in combat to deliver a single deadly attack. As a full-round action, make one attack at your highest base attack bonus. That attack deals double damage, as do any other attacks you make before the start of your next turn.

Planar Fighter
Planar travelers often have some fighting skill. Those devoting a substantial amount of time and effort to the pursuit of planar puissance gain additional powers and tactics useful against planar foes.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a fighter planar substitution level, a character must be about to take his 4th, 8th, or 12th level of fighter.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Fighter planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard fighter class plus Knowledge (the planes).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.


Table: Fighter Planar Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
4th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Planar study
8th	+8/+3	+6	+2	+2	Align puissance
12th	+12/+7/+2	+8	+4	+4	Aura of stability
Class Features
All of the following are features of the fighter''s planar substitution levels.

Planar Study (Ex): At 4th level, a planar fighter learns the secrets of combating foes encountered on the planes. He gains a +2 bonus on all weapon damage rolls against elementals, outsiders, and creatures that would have the extraplanar subtype while on the Material Plane (such as a fiendish dire wolf).

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard fighter at 4th level.

Align Puissance (Su): Once per day, for a number of rounds equal to his fighter class level, a planar fighter of 8th level or higher can use a standard action to align himself so that any weapon he wields is aligned good, evil, lawful, or chaotic, as he chooses. A weapon that is aligned can overcome the damage reduction of certain creatures, usually outsiders of the opposite alignment.

This ability has no effect on a weapon that already has an alignment, such as a holy sword. It affects all other weapons wielded by the fighter, but not his unarmed strikes or natural weapons. The ability comes from the fighter, not the weapon, so if he subsequently gives away or loses the weapon, it does not remain aligned. Likewise, while the fighter is under the effect of this ability, any weapon he picks up acts as if aligned in the manner he activated.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard fighter at 8th level.

Aura of Stability (Su): As a standard action, a planar fighter of 12th level or higher can activate a dimensional anchor effect on himself with a duration of a number of rounds equal to his class level. In addition, anyone with whom he is grappling is likewise affected by the dimensional anchor ability while they are grappling. Spell resistance applies, and the caster level of the ability equals the fighter''s class level.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard fighter at 12th level.

Pugilist
Pugilists don''t waste time learning a large assortment of weapons. Instead they master the simplest of weapons: their own hands. They are boxers and brawlers; tough people who punch hard and weather savage beatings. While often harsh in their fighting and brutal in their appearance, they are, by the very nature of their fighting style, more merciful than most. While fights with more traditionally armed fighters end with dead littering the ground, fights with pugilism end with battered, unconscious opponents.

Class Skills
The pugilist''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Intimidate (Cha), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Swim (Str).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the pugilist.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The pugilist is proficient in the use of all simple weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light).

Bonus Feats: The pugilist gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the pugilist must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to unarmed strike): Alertness, Athletic, Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Bull Rush. Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Improved Trip, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Mobility, Persuasive, Power Attack, Snatch Arrows, Spring Attack, Stunning Fist, Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

Special Abilities: The pugilist gains the Improved Unarmed Strike and Endurance feats for free at 1st level. In addition, her unarmed strikes inflict 1d4 points of damage per strike. Small pugilists inflict 1d3 points of damage. The pugilist may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Combo: The pugilist practices a series of blows designed to flow one after the other, each one setting up the next. When using a combo, average the pugilist''s first two unarmed strike attacks in a full attack and use the resulting bonus for both strikes. For example, a pugilist with a +10/+5 attack progression has a +7/+7 attack progression when using a combo. The pugilist can take this ability more than once, each time adding one more attack gained from a high base attack bonus to the combo.

Heavy Hitting: The pugilist''s unarmed strikes inflict an extra +2 nonlethal damage, even when the pugilist strikes to deal lethal damage. The pugilist can take this ability multiple times but cannot take it until 2nd level.

Iron Jaw: Whenever the pugilist suffers nonlethal damage, the damage is reduced by a number equal to the pugilist''s Constitution bonus. The pugilist also gains a +1 bonus to saves to resist any attack that would leave her stunned.

Shake it Off: The pugilist develops non-lethal damage only and reduces the duration of all stunning effects by 1 round, with a minimum of 1 round. The pugilist can take this ability multiple times; its effects stack.


Raptoran Fighter
The raptoran fighter is a sentinel of the skies, swooping on foes and bringing death from above. A raptoran fighter gives up some of her versatility and defensive prowess, but gains significant airborne advantages.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a raptoran fighter substitution level, a character must be a raptoran about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of fighter.

Class Skills
Raptoran fighter substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard fighter class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the raptoran fighter''s racial substitution levels.

Encumbered Flight (Ex): A 1st-level raptoran fighter can glide while carrying a medium load. When the character gains flight after undertaking her Walk of the Four Winds, she can fly while carrying a medium load.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter''s heavy armor proficiency gained at 1st level.

Airborne Strike (Ex): A 4th-level raptoran fighter gains the ability to use superior positioning to deal extra damage in melee. Whenever the raptoran is flying and higher than her opponent, she gains a +2 bonus on melee weapon damage rolls.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter''s bonus feat gained at 4th level.

Fast Flight (Ex): An 8th-level raptoran fighter''s glide and fly speeds are 10 feet faster than the norm for her race. Fast flight is considered a racial bonus to speed, so it stacks with enhancement bonuses from spells and magic items.

This substitution feature replaces the standard fighter''s bonus feat gained at 8th level.


Table: Raptoran Fighter Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Encumbered flight, bonus feat
4th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Airborne strike
8th	+8/+3	+6	+2	+2	Fast flight

Resolute
Your faith bolsters your resolve, allowing you to stand firm against all foes.

Level: Any even-numbered level.

Replaces: This benefit replaces one of your fighter bonus feats.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can reduce your base attack bonus by one-half and gain a bonus on your Will save equal to the amount of the reduction. This effect lasts until the end of your next action. This is a supernatural ability.

Shield Bearer
Shield bearers are fighters that make the shield their primary focus instead of their weapon. While certainly proficient with a blade, shield bearers possess unparalleled mastery of armor and shields. They often surprise opponents with their technique, parrying with their weapons while smashing back with their shields. When violence comes, they charge to the front ranks, for they are melee fighters first and foremost, eschewing most ranged weapons because of their incompatibility with the warriors beloved shields.

Class Skills
The shield bearer''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), and Ride (Dex).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the shield bearer.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The shield bearer is proficient in the use of all simple and martial weapons, all armor (heavy, medium, and light), and shields (including tower shields). In addition, shield bearers are proficient with armor spikes.

Bonus Feats: Shield bearers must take the Improved Shield Bash feat as their first fighter bonus feat. The shield bearer otherwise gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but she must select bonus feats from the following list (any of the bonus feats that apply to a specific kind of weapon must be applied to a type of shield for the purposes of making shield bash attacks): Blind-Fight, Cleave, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Great Cleave, Great Fortitude, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Feint, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Improved Trip, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Mobility, Persuasive, Power Attack, Spring Attack, Stunning Fist, Toughness, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization, Whirlwind Attack.

Special Abilities: The shield bearer may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Armored Gait: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer treats the armor as one weight category lighter for determining speed penalties. This does not reduce the armor''s weight category for the barbarian bonus movement, ranger class abilities, or other abilities dependent on the armor''s weight category. Thus medium armor would not hinder her speed, while heavy armor would still reduce it, but still allow her to run at four times her normal rate. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

Armored Grace: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer increases the maximum Dexterity bonus of the armor by one when she wears it. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

Armor Optimization: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer adds +1 to the armor bonus of this armor when she wears it, learning to twist and shift in order to take blows on the most protective parts of the armor. The shield bearer loses this bonus whenever she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

Fortification: Choose one type of armor, such as a breastplate. The shield bearer adds +2 to the armor bonus of this armor, but this bonus only applies when an opponent is rolling to confirm a critical hit. This armor bonus stacks with all other armor bonuses, including Armor Optimization. The shield bearer may take this ability multiple times, but each time it applies to a new type of armor.

Shield Strike: The shield bearer may use her shield in place of an unarmed attack to perform special maneuvers. Treat the Shield Strike ability as the Improved Unarmed Attack feat for purposes of taking other feats in the unarmed attack chain, such as Stunning Fist and Deflect Arrows. Instead of having a free hand, the shield bearer must have her shield readied in order to use these feats.

Survivalist
Survivalists are not nature lovers. They do not see themselves as a part of the wilds, and if they had a choice, they would stay within the confines of civilization. Unfortunately, dangers sometimes force people out of the cities, and when that happens, the survivalist is prepared. These people might not love the wilderness, but they can trap game, make shelter, and find fresh water.

Class Skills
The survivalist''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Move Silently (Dex), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Rope (Dex).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the survivalist.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The survivalist is trained in the use of all simple and martial weapons, with light and medium armor, and with shields (except tower shields).

Bonus Feats: The survivalist gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the survivalist must select bonus feats from the following list: Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Combat Reflexes, Diehard, Dodge, Endurance, Far Shot, Great Fortitude, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Bull Rush, Improved Critical, Improved Disarm, Improved Grapple, Improved Initiative, Improved Overrun, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Trip, Improved Unarmed Strike, Iron Will, Lightning Reflexes, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Power Attack, Precise Shot, Run, Self-Sufficient, Shot on the Run, Skill Focus (any class skill), Spring Attack, Stealthy, Toughness, Track, Two-Weapon Fighting, Weapon Finesse, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

Targetteer
There are archers, there are marksmen, and then there is the targetteer. Focusing on the totality of ranged combat rather than settling on a single weapon, the targetteer is a dangerous opponent, for he possesses a reach often longer than it first appears and deadly accuracy.

Class Skills
The targetteer''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), and Ride (Dex).

Class Features
All the following are class features of the targetteer.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: The targetteer is trained in the use of all simple weapons, all ranged martial weapons, with all armors (light, medium, and heavy), and with the buckler. He may also choose two exotic weapon proficiencies at first level, but these must be ranged weapons.

Bonus Feats: The targetteer gains bonus feats as the normal fighter class does, but the targetteer must select bonus feats from the following list: Dodge, Exotic Weapon Proficiency, Far Shot, Greater Weapon Focus, Greater Weapon Specialization, Improved Critical, Improved Initiative, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Unarmed Strike, Lightning Reflexes, Martial Weapon Proficiency, Manyshot, Mobility, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Reload, Rapid Shot, Run, Shot on the Run, Stealthy, Weapon Focus, Weapon Specialization.

Special Abilities: The targetteer may choose any of the following special abilities in place of a bonus feat:

Arrow Swarm: By taking a -5 penalty to all attack rolls for a round, the targetteer may make two additional ranged attacks at his highest attack bonus. The targetteer must have the Rapid Shot feat to take this ability and must be making a full attack to make use of Arrow Swarm.

Sniper: When using the full attack option, the targetteer can sacrifice attacks to gain deadly accuracy. For each attack from a full attack sacrificed, the threat range of the targetteer''s weapon increases by 1. Thus if the targetteer''s ranged attack normally has a threat range of 19-20, sacrificing one attack from a full attack would increase the threat range to 18-20. A sacrificed attack only enhances the next attack. However, a targetteer can sacrifice multiple attacks to further increase the threat range. A targetteer cannot sacrifice all attacks from a full attack action.

Vital Aim: The targetteer may add his Dexterity modifier to his damage rolls with a ranged-weapon attack instead of his Strength bonus. The targetteer cannot replace a Strength penalty to damage rolls with his Dexterity modifier unless his Dexterity modifier is also a penalty. The targetteer cannot use his Dexterity modifier to replace his Strength modifier when attacking creatures immune to critical hits.

Thane
Thanes are professional fighters sworn to protect a clan or tribal chieftain. Serving as bodyguards, companions, and the commanders of their liege''s warbands. Such devoted warriors usually come from the leading or noble families of a liege''s country, clan, or tribe. Loyalty is the most important quality for them, and they are expected to die defending or avenging their liege. In return for a thane''s faithful service, patrons feed, board, and give gifts to their protectors. Thanes from cultures that esteem mounted warriors often embrace the horseman ideal, while those of other societies adopt whatever form of battle is considered most honorable.

The thane is a specialist fighter, much like an evoker is a specialist wizard. Unless otherwise noted, a thane advances in the same manner as a fighter (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of fighter or thane, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level fighter twice.

Class Skills
The thane''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Handle Animal (Cha), Jump (Str), Ride (Dex), and Swim (Str).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the thane.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A thane is proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with all armor (heavy, medium, and light) and shields (including tower shields).

Bonus Feats: The thane gain bonus feats as normal fighters do. In addition to normal fighter bonus feats, the thane may also select Aura of Bravery, Improved Aid Another, and Stalwart as a fighter bonus feat.

Thane''s Vow: At 1st level, a thane devotes himself to a single lord or master. This lord does not have to be an actual ruler, merely any other character the thane determines as being worthy to serve and who accepts the thane''s service. A thane cannot voluntarily change who his lord is for any reason once he has pledged himself to that lord. If the thane''s lord is killed, the thane must exact revenge against his master''s killers or die in the attempt, and should be treated as if under the effects of geas/quest until this mission is fulfilled (this quest cannot be ended prematurely by a remove curse spell). A lordless thane suffers a -4 penalty on all Charisma-based skill checks until he fulfills his vow. After a thane has avenged his previous lord''s death, he is free to devote himself to a new lord and must do so to eliminate the penalty on Charisma-based skill checks.

Thug
The thug is a street fighter, a survivor who learns to mix brute force with a bit of craftiness. He has most of the fighter''s strengths, along with some additional skills to help keep him alive on the mean streets. Despite the name, not all thugs are mere hooligans - many are crafty veterans who use their knowledge of the streets to gain an advantage against their opponents.

Most thugs are nonlawful, though sometimes gangs of thugs with a lawful streak band together.

Class Skills
Add the following skills to the fighter''s class skill list: Bluff, Gather Information, Knowledge (local), and Sleight of Hand. The thug gains skill points per level equal to 4 + Int modifier (and has this number x 4 at 1st level).

Class Features
The thug has all the standard fighter class features, except as noted below.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Thugs are proficient with all simple and martial weapons and with light armor.

Bonus Feats: A thug doesn''t gain the normal fighter bonus feat at 1st level. Also, add Urban Tracking to the list of fighter bonus feats available to the thug.

Warforged Fighter
To many, the words "warforged" and "fighter" seem almost synonymous. Built to serve as soldiers, warforged are indeed singularly suited to the pursuit of the combat arts. The warforged fighter who gives up some of that class''s range of options, however, gains a stability in combat and a greater command of his construct body.

Hit Die: d12.

To take a warforged fighter substitution level, a character must be a warforged about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 4th level of fighter.

Class Skills
Warforged fighter substitution levels grant the following class skills: Craft and Intimidate.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

UPDATE classes 
SET 
    description = 'Dotted across the landscape are monasteries - small, walled cloisters inhabited by monks who pursue personal perfection through action as well as contemplation. They train themselves to be versatile warriors skilled at fighting without weapons or armor. The inhabitants of monasteries headed by good masters serve as protectors of the people. Ready for battle even when barefoot and dressed in peasant clothes, monks can travel unnoticed among the populace, catching bandits, warlords, and corrupt nobles unawares. In contrast, the residents of monasteries headed by evil masters rule the surrounding lands through fear, as an evil warlord and his entourage might. Evil monks make ideal spies, infiltrators, and assassins.

The individual monk is unlikely to care passionately about championing commoners or amassing wealth. She cares primarily for the perfection of her art and, thereby, her personal perfection. Her goal is to achieve a state that is beyond the mortal realm.

A monk approaches an adventure as if it were a personal test. While not prone to showing off, monks are willing to try their skills against whatever obstacles confront them. They are not greedy for material wealth, but they eagerly seek that which can help them perfect their art.

The key feature of the monk is her ability to fight unarmed and unarmored. Thanks to her rigorous training, she can strike as hard as if she were armed and strike faster than a warrior with a sword.

Though a monk casts no spells, she has a magic of her own. She channels a subtle energy, called ki, which allows her to perform amazing feats. The monk''s best-known feat is her ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow. A monk also has a preternatural awareness that allows her to dodge an attack even if she is not consciously aware of it.

As the monk gains experience and power, her mundane and kioriented abilities grow, giving her more and more power over herself and, sometimes, over others.

A monk''s training requires strict discipline. Only those who are lawful at heart are capable of undertaking it.

A monk''s training is her spiritual path. She is innerdirected and capable of a private, mystic connection to the spiritual world, so she needs neither clerics nor gods. Certain lawful gods, however, may appeal to monks, who may meditate on the gods'' likenesses and attempt to emulate their deeds. The three most likely candidates for a monk''s devotion are Heironeous (god of valor), St. Cuthbert (god of retribution), and Hextor (god of tyranny).

A monk typically trains in a monastery. Most monks were children when they joined the monastery, sent to live there when their parents died, when there wasn''t enough food to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monastery had performed for the family. Life in the monastery is so focused that by the time a monk sets off on her own, she feels little connection to her former family or village.

In larger cities, master monks have set up monk schools to teach their arts to those who are interested and worthy. The monks who study at these academies often see their rural cousins from the monasteries as backward.

A monk may feel a deep connection to her monastery or school, to the monk who taught her, to the lineage into which she was trained, or to all of these. Some monks, however, have no sense of connection other than to their own path of personal development. Monks recognize each other as a select group set apart from the rest of the populace. They may feel kinship, but they also love to compete with each other to see whose ki is strongest.

Monasteries are found primarily among humans, who have incorporated them into their ever-evolving culture. Thus, many monks are humans, and many are half-orcs and half-elves who live among humans. Elves are capable of single-minded, long-term devotion to an interest, art, or discipline, and some of them leave the forests to become monks. The monk tradition is alien to dwarf and gnome culture, and halflings typically have too mobile a lifestyle to commit themselves to a monastery, so dwarves, gnomes, and halflings very rarely become monks.

The savage humanoids do not have the stable social structure that allows monk training, but the occasional orphaned or abandoned child from some humanoid tribe winds up in a civilized monastery or is adopted by a wandering master. The evil subterranean elves known as the drow have a small but successful monk tradition.

Monks sometimes seem distant because they often have neither motivation nor skills in common with members of other classes. Monks do, however, work well with the support of others, and they usually prove themselves reliable companions. Role: The monk functions best as an opportunistic combatant, using her speed to get into and out of combat quickly rather than engaging in prolonged melees. She also makes an excellent scout, particularly if she focuses her skill selection on stealth.

Alignment: Any lawful.

Hit Die: d8.

1 The value shown is for Medium monks. See Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage for Small or Large monks.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the monk.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Monks are proficient with club, crossbow (light or heavy), dagger, handaxe, javelin, kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, siangham, sling, and their unarmed strike. Monks are not proficient with any armor or shields. When wearing armor, using a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load, a monk loses her AC bonus, as well as her fast movement and flurry of blows abilities.

AC Bonus (Ex): When unarmored and unencumbered, the monk adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. In addition, a monk gains a +1 bonus to AC at 5th level. This bonus increases by 1 for every five monk levels thereafter (+2 at 10th, +3 at 15th, and +4 at 20th level).

These bonuses to AC apply even against touch attacks or when the monk is flat-footed. She loses these bonuses when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor, when she carries a shield, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

Flurry of Blows (Ex): When unarmored, a monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, she may make one extra attack in a round at her highest base attack bonus, but this attack takes a -2 penalty, as does each other attack made that round. The resulting modified base attack bonuses are shown in the Flurry of Blows Attack Bonus column on Table: The Monk. This penalty applies for 1 round, so it also affects attacks of opportunity the monk might make before her next action. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. A monk must use a full attack action to strike with a flurry of blows.

When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes or with special monk weapons (kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, shuriken, and siangham). She may attack with unarmed strikes and special monk weapons interchangeably as desired. When using weapons as part of a flurry of blows, a monk applies her Strength bonus (not Str bonus x 1-1/2 or x 1/2) to her damage rolls for all successful attacks, whether she wields a weapon in one or both hands. The monk can''t use any weapon other than a special monk weapon as part of a flurry of blows.

In the case of the quarterstaff, each end counts as a separate weapon for the purpose of using the flurry of blows ability. Even though the quarterstaff requires two hands to use, a monk may still intersperse unarmed strikes with quarterstaff strikes, assuming that she has enough attacks in her flurry of blows routine to do so.

When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack she gets from flurry of blows, she gets a second extra attack at her full base attack bonus.

Unarmed Strike: At 1st level, a monk gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat. A monk''s attacks may be with either fist interchangeably or even from elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may even make unarmed strikes with her hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply her full Strength bonus on damage rolls for all her unarmed strikes.

Usually a monk''s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but she can choose to deal nonlethal damage instead with no penalty on her attack roll. She has the same choice to deal lethal or nonlethal damage while grappling.

A monk''s unarmed strike is treated both as a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or natural weapons.

A monk also deals more damage with her unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown on Table: The Monk. The unarmed damage on Table: The Monk is for Medium monks. A Small monk deals less damage than the amount given there with her unarmed attacks, while a Large monk deals more damage; see Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage.

Table: Small or Large Monk Unarmed Damage

Level	Damage (Small Monk)	Damage (Large Monk)
1st-3rd	1d4	1d8
4th-7th	1d6	2d6
8th-11th	1d8	2d8
12th-15th	1d10	3d6
16th-19th	2d6	3d8
20th	2d8	4d8
Bonus Feat: At 1st level, a monk may select either Improved Grapple or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may select either Combat Reflexes or Deflect Arrows as a bonus feat. At 6th level, she may select either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip as a bonus feat. A monk need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

Evasion (Ex): At 2nd level or higher if a monk makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if a monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of evasion.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 3rd level, a monk gains an enhancement bonus to her speed, as shown on Table: The Monk. A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.

Still Mind (Ex): A monk of 3rd level or higher gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from the school of enchantment.

Ki Strike (Su): At 4th level, a monk''s unarmed attacks are empowered with ki. Her unarmed attacks are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. Ki strike improves with the character''s monk level. At 10th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction. At 16th level, her unarmed attacks are treated as adamantine weapons for the purpose of dealing damage to creatures with damage reduction and bypassing hardness.

Slow Fall (Ex): At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm''s reach of a wall can use it to slow her descent. When first using this ability, she takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk''s ability to slow her fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with her monk level until at 20th level she can use a nearby wall to slow her descent and fall any distance without harm.

Purity of Body (Ex): At 5th level, a monk gains immunity to all diseases except for supernatural and magical diseases.

Wholeness of Body (Su): At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal her own wounds. She can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice her current monk level each day, and she can spread this healing out among several uses.

Improved Evasion (Ex): At 9th level, a monk''s evasion ability improves. She still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks, but henceforth she takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless monk does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

Diamond Body (Su): At 11th level, a monk gains immunity to poisons of all kinds.

Abundant Step (Su): At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell dimension door, once per day. Her caster level for this effect is one-half her monk level (rounded down).

Diamond Soul (Ex): At 13th level, a monk gains spell resistance equal to her current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the monk''s spell resistance.

Quivering Palm (Su): Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. She can use this quivering palm attack once a week, and she must announce her intent before making her attack roll. Constructs, oozes, plants, undead, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to her monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a free action), and unless the target makes a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 the monk''s level + the monk''s Wis modifier), it dies. If the saving throw is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time.

Timeless Body (Ex): Upon attaining 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to her ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that she has already taken, however, remain in place. Bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when her time is up.

Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex): A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.

Empty Body (Su): At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 round per monk level per day, as though using the spell etherealness. She may go ethereal on a number of different occasions during any single day, as long as the total number of rounds spent in an ethereal state does not exceed her monk level.

Perfect Self: At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. She is forevermore treated as an outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever the monk''s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains damage reduction 10/magic, which allows her to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonmagical weapon or by any natural attack made by a creature that doesn''t have similar damage reduction. Unlike other outsiders, the monk can still be brought back from the dead as if she were a member of her previous creature type.

Ex-Monks
A monk who becomes nonlawful cannot gain new levels as a monk but retains all monk abilities.

Like a member of any other class, a monk may be a multiclass character, but multiclass monks face a special restriction. A monk who gains a new class or (if already multiclass) raises another class by a level may never again raise her monk level, though she retains all her monk abilities.

Aquatic Monk
The unarmed combat traditions of monks are especially useful in an environment that impedes most weapon use. Claws, teeth, and tails are equally deadly underwater as on land, making sahuagin monks especially dangerous. Even those without a native swimming ability can grapple as effectively as aquatic creatures. Monks whose unarmed strikes normally deal bludgeoning damage either arm themselves with appropriate piercing weapons such as the dagger and siangham or take feats such as Toothed Blow to make their underwater attacks more effective. Faster movement allows even an air-breathing monk to move more quickly in the water, while his adroitness at Balance, Climb, Jump, and Tumble let him move like a squirrel through ships'' riggings or keep his feet on the most violently storm-tossed ship.

Fast Movement (Ex): Monks who possess a racial swim speed can choose to apply their fast movement bonus to their swim speed instead of their land speed. The choice must be made when the character gains the class feature and cannot be changed later. This benefit still applies only when the monk is wearing no armor and not carrying a medium or heavy load.

Water Step (Ex): At 4th level, a monk can move with a step so quick and light that he can walk across short distances of water. The maximum distance across which the monk can move is equal to the slow fall distance he otherwise would have (20 feet at 4th level, 30 feet at 6th level, 40 feet at 8th level, and so on up to a maximum of 90 feet at 18th level). He can divide his water-step movement between two consecutive turns, as long as he begins or ends every turn on solid ground. If the monk exceeds his water step distance without setting foot on land (or some other solid footing), or stops moving while still on water, he immediately falls in. He can use water step as part of a move action, including charging or running, and can even make Tumble checks while using water step.

This alternate class feature replaces the standard monk''s slow fall class feature.

Bane of the Clockwork
Due to your knowledge of all things constructed from metal and coils, you are intimately aware of a construct''s flaws.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you never gain the slow fall ability, nor your 6th-level bonus feat.

Benefit: You can deal critical hit damage against constructs when you attack with unarmed strikes (not with monk special weapons). Constructs are no longer immune to your Stunning Fist or quivering palm attacks.

Broken One
These kind and enduring monks dedicated to Ilmater are focused on defending the faithful and temples of the Broken God while acting as agents of punishment against those who would cruelly harm others. They combine the skills of healer and hunter in the service of their deity. They often assist other servants of the Triad when injustices against the innocent have occurred.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Broken One substitution level, a character must have Ilmater as her patron deity, be a member of the Broken Ones, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 6th, or 7th level of monk.

Class Skills
Broken One substitution levels have the class skills of the standard monk class plus Heal and Survival.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Broken One substitution levels.

Lay on Hands (Su): At 3rd level, a Broken One can gain the ability to heal wounds with her touch (see the paladin class feature). If the character has a Charisma score of 11 or lower, she can heal a number of points of damage each day equal to her monk class level.

This benefit replaces the still mind class feature gained by a standard monk.

Tenacious Tracker (Su): Beginning at 6th level, a Broken One gains the ability to follow the trail of those cruel enough to torture and maim others. She receives Track as a bonus feat. She gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track those with Loviatar as a patron deity.

Furthermore, whenever she physically touches the flesh of one who has been injured within the previous hour by someone who has Loviatar as his patron deity, she receives a clear mental image of that person''s true appearance.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard monk at 6th level.

Locate Creature (Sp): Starting at 7th level, a Broken One can use locate creature once per day, but only when attempting to find a creature that has Loviatar as a patron deity. Her caster level is equal to her class level.

This benefit replaces the wholeness of body class feature gained by a standard monk at 7th level.

Chaos Monk
Chaos monks practice an art that supplicates chance and anarchy. Their core philosophy preaches that ki is an unbridled energy more potent when untamed. To most, the concept of chaotic monks seems a contradiction, yet those who have witnessed the effects firsthand are loath to deny its power.

The chaos monk is a variant monk. Unless otherwise noted, a chaos monk advances in the same manner as a monk (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of monk or chaos monk, she may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level monk twice.

Note: The chaos monk is an optional rule that might seriously alter your game. A DM should be comfortable with the concept before allowing it into his campaign.

Alignment: Any chaotic.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the chaos monk.

Flailing Strike (Ex): Chaos monks practice martial arts with a reckless abandon that shifts drastically from humorously ineffective to frighteningly deadly. At the expense of accuracy, the chaos monk can make a roll (of the die type shown on the chaos monk chart) to determine how many extra attacks she can make (minimum 0). Regardless of the number of attacks made, she suffers an attack penalty on all of them. At 1st level she takes a-2 penalty, at 5th level it decreases to -1, and at 9th level it disappears. Using a flailing strike requires a full-round action and can only be made as part of an unarmed attack or with special monk weapons.

Erratic Advance (Ex): At 5th level, a chaos monk can attempt to daze an opponent with a wild and erratic rush. As part of a charge, a chaos monk can activate this ability, forcing her opponent to make a Will save (DC 10 + chaos monk class level) or become dazed for 1 round. The chaos monk can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day).

Displacing Stance (Sp): Beginning at 7th level, the chaos monk''s movements become so wild and unpredictable that she can partially displace herself for a number of rounds per day equal to half her chaos monk class level (these rounds need not be consecutive). This grants the chaos monk a 20% chance that an attacker misses because of the displacing stance. At 12th level the miss chance increases to 50%. This requires a standard action to enter.

Freedom of Thought (Su): The chaos monk''s thought process become so anarchic at 11th level that once per day, should she fail a Will save against a mind-affecting effect, she may immediately reroll her save (with the same modifiers to the roll). She must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.

Anarchic Self (Su): Same as perfect self except the monk gains the chaotic subtype.


Decisive Strike
Flurry of blows can be exciting to use - just look at all the attack rolls you can make - but in practice it can lead to a flurry of misses. The decisive strike alternative class feature turns your typical combat maneuver from a whirl of action into a methodical and devastating attack.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain flurry of blows (or any later improvements to that class feature).

Benefit: As a full-round action, make one attack with an unarmed strike or a special monk weapon, using your highest base attack bonus but taking a -2 penalty on this attack roll. If the attack hits, it deals double damage (as does any other attack you make before the start of your next turn). If you use this strike to deliver a stunning attack, increase the save DC to resist the stun by 2. This is an extraordinary ability.

At 5th level, the penalty on the attack roll lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears.

At 11th level, you can make two attacks when using this class feature, though no more than one attack can target a single creature. Both attacks use your highest base attack bonus.

Dark Moon Disciple
The Monks of the Dark Moon are sorcerer-monks who have dedicated their bodies, minds, and souls to Shar, the Lady of Loss. Because they deal with shadows and the Shadow Weave, they have developed special powers to take advantage of their connection to Shar.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a Dark Moon Disciple substitution level, a character must be a member of the Monks of the Dark Moon sect, have Shar as her patron deity, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 7th, or 12th level of monk.

Class Skills
A Dark Moon Disciple has the same selection of class skills as a standard monk does.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All the following are features of the Dark Moon Disciple substitution levels.

Darkvision (Ex): At 3rd level, a Dark Moon Disciple gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

This benefit replaces the still mind class feature that the standard monk gains at 3rd level.

Shadow Blend (Su): In any conditions other than full daylight, a 7th-level Dark Moon Disciple can disappear into the shadows, gaining total concealment. Artificial light does not negate this ability, though a daylight spell does.

This benefit replaces the wholeness of body class feature that the standard monk gains at 7th level.

Walk the Shadows (Su): At 12th level, a Dark Moon Disciple can jump from shadow to shadow. This ability works like the dimension door spell, except that the Dark Moon Disciple can leave and arrive only in areas of shadowy illumination. The caster level equals the character''s monk level, and Dark Moon Disciple substitution levels count as monk levels for this purpose. This ability is usable once per day.

This benefit replaces the abundant step class feature that a standard monk gains at 12th level.

Draconic Fist
Monks who follow the Way of the Draconic Fist seek to harness their inner ki just as dragons harness their innate magical ability. While you give up versatility in combat, the ability to add energy to your unarmed strikes makes them more potent against a wide range of foes.

Class: Monk.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard monk''s bonus feat at 1st level.

Benefit: When you select this class feature, choose one energy type from among acid, cold, electricity, or fire. As a swift action, you can choose for your next unarmed attack made in this round to deal an extra 1d6 points of damage of the chosen energy type. This extra damage improves to 2d6 points at 5th level, and by another 1d6 points every five levels thereafter. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your class level.

Eberron Monk
Monks in Eberron are an unusual mixture of contemplative scholars and martial artists. They are called to a life of community apart from the world in which they copy books, preserve the annals of history, and practice the skills they need to defend their faith and fight for the cause of their church.

Monks in Eberron have access to feats representing unique fighting styles derived from their religious traditions. Most monks in Khorvaire follow the religion of the Sovereign Host. Good and neutral monks worship Dol Dorn, the Lord of Strength at Arms. Evil monks are devoted to the Mockery, flaying their own skin in identification with their disfigured patron.

Bonus Feats: Good or neutral monks devoted to Dol Dorn may choose Whirling Steel Strike as their bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level, in addition to the normal options at those levels. They must still meet all prerequisites for the feat.

Evil monks devoted to the Mockery may choose Flensing Strike as their bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level, in addition to the normal options at those levels. They must still meet all prerequisites for the feat.

Feign Death
A clever villain has many contingencies in place, so that if a plan goes awry, he can beat a hasty retreat. In exchange for some ability to evade damage, he can enter a state that is indistinguishable from death.

Class: Monk, ranger, or rogue.

Level: 2nd (monk or rogue) or 9th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability. If your class would grant you improved evasion at a higher level, you instead gain evasion.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can enter a catatonic state in which you appear to be dead. While feigning death, you cannot see or feel anything, but you retain the ability to smell, hear, and otherwise follow what is going on around you.

While under the effect of this ability, you are immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, ability drain, negative levels, and death effects. Attempts to resuscitate you, such as raise dead or reincarnation, automatically fail, though resurrection and true resurrection immediately end your feign death ability.

Spells and other effects that assess your current condition, such as status and deathwatch, indicate that you are dead. However, a character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) can discern that you are actually alive.

You can remain in the catatonic state indefinitely, though you still require food, water, and air. Emerging from feigned death is a standard action.

Fighting Styles
In literature and lore, the combat styles and aptitudes of a monk depend greatly on where (or by whom) she was trained. The standard monk, however, presents only a relatively limited variety of options to personalize your monk.

A 1st-level monk (regardless of character level) may select one of the fighting styles described below. By selecting one of these fighting styles, she dictates which bonus feats she gains at 1st, 2nd, and 6th level (when a standard monk normally gains one of two bonus feats). In addition, at 1st level she gets a +2 bonus on checks involving a skill of her selection (in exchange for the freedom of choice she gives up by preselecting her bonus feats). Finally, she gains a bonus ability at 6th level if she has met the listed prerequisites by that time. If the character hasn''t yet met the prerequisites, she doesn''t gain the bonus ability, even if she meets the prerequisites at some later time.

These fighting styles serve a variety of purposes in a campaign. Each one might symbolize a different monastery, creating a rivalry (friendly or unfriendly) between their students. Perhaps a specific master teaches each style only to a few select students, meaning that a monk must prove herself worthy before pursuing the training. Or maybe each monk simply chooses her own way in life, styling herself after great martial artists of the past.

A monk can abandon her fighting style by selecting a different bonus feat at 2nd or 6th level; however, if she does so, she loses the bonus on skill checks gained at 1st level and never gains the bonus ability of the fighting style (even if she meets the prerequisites).

BUDDHIST MONK
Born Siddhartha Guatama in the 6th century BCE, Buddha founded a philosophy on Four Noble Truths: all life is suffering, attachment causes suffering, you can end suffering by overcoming attachment, and a path exists to accomplish this. This path is called the Eightfold Path, a guide for living a virtuous and noble life. Buddha believed that this virtuous life meant a rejection of anger, greed, and jealously, and a constant dedication to good will and self-improvement. But believing these things is not enough to end suffering. Buddha taught you must live the Eightfold Path in thought, action, and desire. In doing so, you can achieve a state of perfection free from desire and suffering - thus becoming enlightened.

Part teacher and part ascetic, a Buddhist monk wanders from villages to serene mountaintops searching for the path of wisdom. Even after attaining enlightenment, some monks still adventure. Known as bodhisattvas in the Buddhist tradition, they attained enlightenment but refused Nirvana so as to teach others how to seek the way. Such teachers are greatly revered.

A Buddhist monk adventures to seek knowledge and attain enlightenment. In addition, he adventures to teach others about the path of enlightenment and the inevitable suffering that desire causes. Because the Buddhist monk uses an exalted feat, a monk must be lawful good to take this fighting style.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Sense Motive.
1st-Level Feat:	Iron Will.
2nd-Level Feat:	Combat Expertise.
6th-Level Feat:	Intuitive Attack.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	Your quest for enlightenment has focused your intuition. The bonus granted by your still mind ability increases to +5.
Prerequisites:	Concentrations 5 ranks, Sense Motive 9 ranks.
COBRA STRIKE
Monks of the Cobra Strike Academy specialize in agility and defense. Inspired by the lighting-fast strike of the venomous serpent, the Cobra Strike school of martial arts teaches its students to combine mobility with deadly accuracy. By making herself hard to pin down, the Cobra Strike monk forces the enemy to fight on her terms. Although some claim the school was founded twelve centuries ago by a renegade yuan-ti, this is most likely an idle boast. Nevertheless, the masters of the Cobra Strike Academy are legendary for their cruel methods of teaching, a tradition that tends to create hard-hearted students. The masters of the school point to the lack of failed Cobra Strike students in the world as evidence of the efficiency of their methods, but many whisper that it more accurately points to the efficiency of the school in eliminating those who meet with the displeasure of the masters.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Escape Artist.
1st-Level Feat:	Dodge
2nd-Level Feat:	Mobility.
6th-Level Feat:	Spring Attack.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	The dodge bonus to Armor Class granted by your Dodge feat increases to +2.
Prerequisites:	Balance 4 ranks, Escape Artist 9 ranks.
DENYING STANCE
The Denying Stance seeks to neutralize the opponent''s maneuvers, thwarting him at every turn until he becomes so frustrated that he makes a crucial error. An inherently defensive tradition, the Denying Stance was created many years ago by a halfling whose town was controlled by a gang of monks practicing the Overwhelming Attack style. It spread like wildfire through the youth of the town, and within three years the cruel overlords had been driven out. Today, Denying Stance is widely practiced by those willing to learn the discipline of a patient defense.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Tumble.
1st-Level Feat:	Improved Grapple.
2nd-Level Feat:	Combat Reflexes.
6th-Level Feat:	Improved Disarm.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	When fighting defensively or using the Combat Expertise feat, you gain a +2 bonus on grapple checks and disarm attempts.
Prerequisites:	Tumble 9 ranks, Combat Expertise.
FRANCISCAN FRIAR
Founded in 1209 by St. Francis of Assisi, the Franciscans (also known as Grey Friars) practiced charity and led lives as mendicants - that is, they practiced begging as a lifestyle.

Friars maintained an ascetic life organized around vows of poverty, humility, and chastity. The Church expected them to forgo material possessions, live in faith and obedience, and eschew the roles of husbands and fathers in exchange for serving God. Friars differed from monks in the application of their vows to their faith. Whereas monks maintained an ascetic life in monastic seclusion, friars kept no permanent abode. Rather, they begged for a living and performed charity in all acts while traveling the countryside. Peasants recognized the Franciscan Friars as teachers and healers. Living alongside the poor earned them first-hand knowledge of the hardships of poverty, which in turn earned them respect among both peasant and noble alike.

Franciscan friars emphasize humility and charity as wandering teachers. They adventure to help the poor and bring relief to those who suffer. Because the Franciscan friar uses an exalted feat, a monk must be lawful good to take this fighting style.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Heal.
1st-Level Feat:	Self-Sufficient.
2nd-Level Feat:	Vow of Chastity.
6th-Level Feat:	Diehard.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	Your work with the poor and the suffering has taught you many secrets of healing. You gain the ability to cast cure light wounds, purify food and drink, and remove disease once each per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equals half your monk level).
Prerequisites:	Heal 4 ranks, Survival 4 ranks.
HAND AND FOOT
Students of the Hand and Foot style learn to use their appendages for both offense and defense. This style closely resembles the "traditional" fighting style of the D&D monk, and thus is usually among the most common in any campaign that includes martial artists. The origins of the Hand and Foot technique are lost to the mists of time. Today, it is taught in almost every town large enough to support a school of martial arts, and by solitary masters even in tiny villages. Its simple elegance and effectiveness ensures that it never goes completely out of style. Combining offense and defense, it is among the most well-rounded and balanced fighting styles practiced today.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Balance.
1st-Level Feat:	Stunning Fist.
2nd-Level Feat:	Deflect Arrows.
6th-Level Feat:	Improved Trip.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	You gain a +2 bonus on attacks of opportunity made against an opponent attempting to bull rush or trip you, and a +4 bonus on Dexterity or Strength checks to avoid being tripped or bull rushed.
Prerequisites:	Balance 9 ranks, Tumble 4 ranks.
INVISIBLE EYE
Monks of the Invisible Eye rely on their other senses, particularly hearing, to aid them in combat. To the uninitiated, the style appears essentially defensive, yet a master of the Invisible Eye learns to turn defensive awareness into offensive prowess. The Invisible Eye style was created by an order of monks who voluntarily blinded themselves in order to gain a deeper spiritual awareness. Thankfully to newer students, the modern teachers of the style don''t demand such personal sacrifice. In memory of the founders of the style, however, all students spend the entire first year of their training blindfolded. These blindfolds are removed in a ceremony called "The Awakening."

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Listen.
1st-Level Feat:	Combat Reflexes.
2nd-Level Feat:	Lightning Reflexes.
6th-Level Feat:	Blind-Fight.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	When unarmed and fighting defensively, using Combat Expertise, or using the total defense action, increase the dodge bonus to Armor Class that you gain from using that tactic by 1.
Prerequisites:	Listen 9 ranks, Agile.
KNIGHT HOSPITALLER
The Knights of the Hospital of St. Joseph of Jerusalem, also called the Knights Hospitaller, played a central role in the Christian crusades of the Middle Ages. Founded in the 12th century, the Knights Hospitaller are more commonly associated with the martial image of their rival counterparts, the Knights Templar. Both featured strongly in the Christian campaigns to reclaim Jerusalem and the Holy Land, known in Europe as Outremer: the land beyond the sea.

Originally, the Knights Hospitaller formed a monastic brotherhood dedicated to aiding and protecting pilgrims in the Holy Land. Pilgrims traveling from Europe could count on protection and shelter from the knights. Eventually, with the emergence of the Knights Templar, they morphed into a military organization during the centuries of crusades. Like the Knights Templar, they combined a monastic lifestyle with a knightly one, becoming Medieval Europe''s first warrior-priests. Renowned for their courage and martial prowess, they came to lead large armies into battle and served as an elite fighting force in Outremer.

A Knight Hospitaller adventures to protect others or some sacred and honored site.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Spot.
1st-Level Feat:	Weapon Focus (any).
2nd-Level Feat:	Combat Expertise.
6th-Level Feat:	Weapon Specialization (as Weapon Focus).
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	You are skilled at protecting others. If you use Combat Expertise, the bonus you gain also applies to one adjacent ally of your choice who is not using Combat Expertise.
Prerequisites:	Spot 9 ranks, Combat Reflexes.
KYOKUSHINKAI KARATE
Kyokushinkai karate, or the "School of Ultimate Truth," is an aggressive Japanese form of martial arts characterized by its highly offensive nature and emphasis on intense conditioning. Kyokushinkai practitioners perform a variety of brutal body hardening exercises during training to callus their bodies in preparation for martial combat. Stylistically, monks who practice kyokushinkai distinguish themselves from other linear martial arts forms in their use of circular movements when executing strikes.

In combat, a student of kyokushinkai engages the enemy purposefully, without hesitation. She makes few extemporaneous movements. The monk launches into an unyielding maelstrom of vicious kicks and punches, seeking to knockout or incapacitate her opponent as quickly as possible.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Survival.
1st-Level Feat:	Endurance.
2nd-Level Feat:	Toughness.
6th-Level Feat:	Weapon Focus (unarmed strike).
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	You permanently gain 6 hit points.
Prerequisites:	Concentration 9 ranks, Die Hard.
METERED STYLE
The "metered" fighting style is a discipline that parallels a pattern of rhythmic metered units within a poem. The monk commits a poem to memory and recites it silently during combat.

The smallest metrical unit in poetry is called the "syllable." There are two kinds of syllables: stressed and unstressed. The fighting style mirrors these metrical units in combat. Stressed syllables represent the execution of quick thrusts or strikes. Unstressed syllables indicate executing counters or defensive maneuvers. The metrical unit in poetry known as the "foot" is a group of two or more of these stressed or unstressed syllables. This metrical unit is represented in the fighting style as a more extensive series of move combinations. A foot predominately containing stressed syllables is considered more offensive in nature, while a foot predominately containing unstressed syllables is considered more defensive. The strengths of this style lie within its precision, accuracy, and strict discipline. Its weakness comes in successfully finding and maintaining the metered rhythm of the selected poem.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Concentration.
1st-Level Feat:	Defensive Metered Foot.
2nd-Level Feat:	Offensive Metered Foot.
6th-Level Feat:	Toughness.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	You may take 10 on any Strength- or Dexterity-based skill check, even if distraction would normally not allow you to do so.
Prerequisites:	Concentration 9 ranks, Skill Focus (any Strength- or Dexterity-based skill).
OVERWHELMING ATTACK
A monk trained in the Overwhelming Attack style always presses the advantage, preferring all-out offense over any form of defense. Some monks trained in other styles accuse them of unnecessary brutality, but it''s hard to argue with the results. The Overwhelming Attack style is popular among the larger and stronger races, including half-orcs and even the occasional stone giant. It tends to be a very showy style, with many intimidating flourishes mixed in with devastating strikes. Monks who practice this style tend to be enemies of monks of the Denying Stance, thanks to an old enmity between the two styles.

1st-Level skill Bonus:	Intimidate.
1st-Level Feat:	Power Attack.
2nd-Level Feat:	Improved Bull Rush.
6th-Level Feat:	Improved Overrun.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	If you have used Intimidate to demoralize your opponent at any time within the previous 10 rounds, you gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks made to bull rush or overrun that opponent.
Prerequisites:	Intimidate 4 ranks, Perform (dance) 4 ranks.
PASSIVE WAY
The Passive Way focuses on making your opponent overreach himself or underestimate your skill. A monk who practices this style typically opens combat in a defensive stance, first taking measure of her opponent before stepping in to take advantage of a momentary opening in the opponent''s defenses. This complex style originated among the gith during their long enslavement by the mind flayers. Over the many generations, it has been passed down from teacher to student, usually in private tutelage. Today, the githzerai remain the most common practitioners of the style, although it is believed that some rare githyanki might also teach it to willing students.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Bluff.
1st-Level Feat:	Combat Expertise.
2nd-Level Feat:	Improved Trip.
6th-Level Feat:	Improved Feint.
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	You gain a +4 bonus on Strength checks made to trip an opponent who is denied his Dexterity bonus to Armor Class.
Prerequisites:	Bluff 4 ranks, Sense Motive 4 ranks, Skill Focus (Bluff).
SACRED PATH OF HEIRONEOUS
Sacred enforcers of each lawful deity follow a tradition unique to their faith, as represented by sacred path fighting styles. A monk must have the same alignment of her deity in order to follow her deity''s sacred path.

Sacred enforcers of the god of valor are untiring in their faith and relentless in hunting down those who oppose it.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Diplomacy.
1st-Level Feat:	Endurance.
2nd-Level Feat:	Negotiator.
6th-Level Feat:	Weapon Specialization (longsword).

SHINTO MONK
Shintoism is a Japanese religion dating from around the 4th century BCE. Its beliefs center on nature reverence and worshiping spirits, called kami. Historically, it is a spiritual religion without strong direction from doctrine or divine writings. Rather, Shintoism describes a universal natural force that pervades all living beings. Translated as "the Way from the Gods," it emphasizes the relationship between mortals and the kami. It is a way of thinking and acting that maintains the mortal connection to the natural world.

Shinto monks revere the natural world. They honor its deep beauty and natural order that sustains and protects all people. Kami connect mortals to this natural order, the spiritual realm that pervades all living things. Because it pervades all life, people must act to maintain its balance. Shintoism emphasizes purity of body and heart, rebirth and rejuvenation, and the order of the group over the desires of the individual. Shinto monks regard animals as messengers of the kami and recognize many natural places as sacred, like small forest glades or hidden mountain valleys. Water is often prominent in these sacred places because of its symbolic connection to purity and rebirth.

A Shinto monk adventures to maintain the balance and nature of the kami. He hopes to discover sacred places of nature and to establish a shrine to honor them. Because the Shinto monk uses exalted feats, a monk must be lawful good to take this fighting style.

SLEEPING TIGER
The Sleeping Tiger style mixes smooth motions with powerful strikes. It favors a quick, first-strike approach, preferably from a position of ambush. This is among the more physically challenging of the known fighting styles, demanding a combination of strength and agility of those who would master it. For that reason, it is also one of the rarer styles, taught by only a handful of senseis throughout the lands. Even after you find one of these rare teachers, you must then undergo rigorous tests of body and mind to prove your worth, as these teachers don''t waste their time with those unfit for the training.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Hide.
1st-Level Feat:	Weapon Finesse.
2nd-Level Feat:	Improved Initiative.
6th-Level Feat:	Improved Sunder.

UNDYING WAY
Monks of the Undying Way believe in patience above all else. They work to outlast their opponent by means of superior endurance. The Undying Way is popular among dwarves, who claim to have invented the style. Most believe this claim without difficulty, since the style takes advantage of dwarven durability. The masters of the Undying Way are called "Immovables" and are highly respected within dwarven communities. The fact that these masters produce students well-qualified to defend those communities doesn''t hurt.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Concentration.
1st-Level Feat:	Toughness.

WAY OF THE SHACKLED BEAST
All shifters face the beast within. Some cannot keep it chained and unleash its animal fury on their enemies. Others stare into the fierce visage of the beast with a cold gaze and learn to channel their rage into complete martial mastery. This path of self-cultivation is referred to as the Way of the Shackled Beast and many shifters train in its secrets, learning to hone their fighting skills through self-control and a unique system of martial arts focused on their shapechanger physiology and spiritual path.

The Way of the Shackled Beast is a new fighting style available to shifter monks. Shifter monks who practice the Way of the Shackled Beast utilize the ferocity and power inherent in their race.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Jump.

WING CHUN KUEN
Wing chun kuen (sometimes referred to as wing chun gung fu), or "sticking hands," is an intricate martial art best described as a southern Chinese boxing style. Students develop their hand speed, counter-punching, and trapping abilities on wooden dummies and through blindfolded exercises. Practitioners utilize a variety of simple, deceptively effective techniques (such as the one-inch punch popularized by Bruce Lee) to incapacitate their opponents.

In combat, a monk who practices wing chun kuen advocates engaging opponents at close range, then adapting to the attacks of an opponent. Perfectly timed counterstrikes, rapid straight punches, and precise footwork all define the art.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Listen.
1st-Level Feat:	Combat Reflexes.
2nd-Level Feat:	Cleave.
6th-Level Feat:	Improved Critical (unarmed strike).
6th-Level Bonus Ability:	When you enter combat and aren''t surprised, you gain a bonus on your initiative equal to your Wisdom bonus (if any).
Prerequisites:	Listen 9 ranks, Improved Initiative.
WUSHU
Translated as "Chinese Martial Arts" or "the Art of War," wushu combines hard kicks and strikes with softer, more indirect methods of self-defense in a highly acrobatic style. The art places emphasis on aesthetics, encouraging fluidity and beauty in the execution of techniques. Wushu practitioners are also renown for their athletic ability, speed, and balance. Sometimes mislabeled as kung fu, cinema has popularized this style of martial arts, most notably in the films of Jet Li. Monks of this style can easily adapt their technique to a given opponent or situation.

In combat, a monk who studies wushu engages his opponent with tactical precision. The wushu stylist uses hit and run tactics to frustrate her adversary and weaken her opponent''s resolve. Wushu practitioners are characterized by their uncanny mobility. They can blindside their opponents with series of highly acrobatic aerial maneuvers and disorienting attacks.

1st-Level Skill Bonus:	Tumble.
1st-Level Feat:	Improved Initiative.
2nd-Level Feat:	Power Attack.
6th-Level Feat:	Improved Feint.

Bonus Feats: 1st level - Improved Grapple or Point-Blank Shot.

2nd level - Stunning Fist or Deflect Arrows.

6th level - Improved Trip or Rapid Fire.


Halfling Monk
Monk seems a counterintuitive selection for the halfling at first glance, since the halfling incurs significant penalties to her ability to deal damage in melee because of her Small size. A halfling monk, however, can learn to focus on mobility and eventually even neutralize some of the larger creatures'' advantages over her.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a halfling monk substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 7th level of monk.

A halfling monk who selects any racial substitution level for her monk class can freely multiclass between the monk and rogue classes.

Class Skills
Halfling monk substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard monk class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the halfling monk''s racial substitution levels.

Skirmish (Ex): A halfling monk relies on mobility to deal extra damage and improve her defense. At 1st level, a halfling monk deals an extra 1d6 points of damage on all attacks during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The extra damage applies only to attacks made with unarmed strikes or special monk weapons (that is, the weapons a normal monk can use as part of a flurry of blows), and only on attacks taken during the monk''s turn. This bonus increases to an extra 2d6 points of damage at 11th level.

The extra damage only applies against a living creature with a discernible anatomy. Undead, constructs, oozes, plants, incorporeal creatures, and creatures immune to extra damage from critical hits are not vulnerable to this additional damage. The monk must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. Halfling monks can apply this additional damage to ranged attacks made while skirmishing, but only if the target is within 30 feet.

At 5th level, the monk also gains a +1 competence bonus to Armor Class during any round in which she moves at least 10 feet. The bonus applies as soon as the monk has moved 10 feet, and lasts until the start of her next turn. This bonus improves to +2 at 15th level.

The monk loses this ability when wearing armor or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk''s flurry of blows ability. A halfling monk who selects this substitution level gains no benefit from any feature that improves or augments the flurry of blows class feature (such as the 11th-level monk''s greater flurry ability).

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, a halfling monk gains Weapon Finesse as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk''s bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

Size Matters Not (Ex): At 7th level, a halfling monk learns to neutralize some of the natural advantage gained by particularly large opponents.

A halfling monk with Improved Grapple gains a +4 bonus on grapple checks made against opponents at least two size categories larger than herself. This is in addition to the +4 bonus granted by the feat.

A halfling monk with Stunning Fist gains a +4 bonus on her stunning fist DC for stunning attacks made against opponents at least two size categories larger than herself.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk''s wholeness of body ability gained at 7th level.

Hin Disciple
Halfling monks of the Hin Fist are trained to use a foe''s size against it. Their fighting style emphasizes bringing down larger foes and evading their attacks.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a Hin Disciple substitution level, a character must be a halfling member of the Hin Fist order, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 1st, 6th, or 9th level of monk.

Class Skills
A Hin Disciple has the same selection of class skills as a standard monk does.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

9th	+6/+1	+6	+6	+6	The harder they fall	+6/+6/+1	1d8	+1	+30 ft.
Class Features
All the following are features of the Hin Disciple substitution levels.

Bonus Feats: At 1st level, a Hin Disciple monk may choose either Underfoot Combat or Stunning Fist as a bonus feat, instead of Improved Grapple. At 2nd level, he can choose between Improved Trip and Combat Reflexes as a bonus feat. He need not meet the prerequisites for these feats. The Hin Disciple does not gain a bonus feat at 6th level.

Underfoot Combat: You can move into or through a space occupied by a Large or larger foe without provoking attacks of opportunity. While you are in a square occupied by a Large or larger creature, you gain a +4 cover bonus to AC against all attacks, even those made by the creature whose space you occupy.

Blur of Motion (Ex): A 6th-level Hin Disciple with at least 5 ranks in Tumble can use the total defense option and still make a single attack in the same round. Blur of motion is a full-round action that can be used only against Large or larger foes.

This benefit replaces the choice of bonus feats that a standard monk gains at 6th level.
The Harder They Fall (Ex): A 9th-level Hin Disciple monk who has taken Improved Trip may grant allies some of that feat''s benefit. When the Hin Disciple trips a foe whose square he occupies, every ally within melee reach of the downed foe may immediately make a single attack at its full attack bonus on that opponent. Each ally also gains the +4 bonus on attack rolls for attacking a prone foe. This attack is made on the Hin Disciple''s turn and does not count against the number of attacks that the allies can make on their own turns. No combination of feats or abilities can grant a second attack by any ally during the Hin Disciple''s turn.

This benefit replaces the standard monk''s improved evasion ability. Furthermore, the Hin Disciplemay never gain improved evasion from any class in the future.

Holy Monk
A monk who is particularly devoted to her religious beliefs gains divine powers in trade for some of her other talents.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Bonus feats at 1st and 6th level.

Gain: Aura of courage, smite evil, turn undead (all as paladin).

Multiclass Options: This monk can multiclass between paladin and monk with no penalty. Her monk class levels stack with paladin levels for determining her daily uses of smite evil and her effective turning level.

Holy Strike
Your fists and monk weapons gain the power of your beliefs and can strike your opponents for extra damage.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the ki strike (magic) class feature.

Benefit: When you hit an evil creature with your unarmed strike attack or with a monk melee weapon, your attack is considered good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction and deals an extra ld6 points of damage. Holy strike is a supernatural ability.

Special: Evil monks can select this ability, but their attacks are considered evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Hunter Monk
After mastering the basic talents of martial arts, some monks are selected to trade life in the monastery for a life hunting the enemies of his order.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Bonus feat (1st level), slow fall.

Gain: Favored enemy (as ranger), swift tracker (as ranger), Survival as class skill.

Multiclass Options: This monk can multiclass between ranger and monk with no penalty. Her monk class levels stack with ranger levels for determining when she gains new favored enemies.

Illuminated Monk
Some monks find focus in meditation, cloistering themselves away to hone their intellects as well as their physiques and wits. Illuminated monks often serve as archive-keepers in libraries and teachers in schools and universities. Just as the sun personifies reason and wisdom, the illuminated monk studies all varieties of lore and passes on his knowledge to others.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take an illuminated monk substitution level, a character must come from a sun-centered society or worship a sun deity, and must be about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 6th level of monk.

Class Skills
Illuminated monk substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard monk class.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the illuminated monk''s substitution levels.

Bonus Feat: At 1st level, an illuminated monk may select Skill Focus as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, an illuminated monk may select either Investigator or Negotiator as a bonus feat.

These substitution features replace the standard monk''s bonus feats gained at 1st and 2nd level.

Meditative Focus (Ex): At 6th level, the illuminated monk can use meditation to focus his mind on the details of a particular skill. Every day at dawn, the illuminated monk may spend 15 minutes in quiet contemplation, meditating on the specifics of a certain skill. He cannot be interrupted during his meditation or he must start the process over again. Until the following dawn, he receives the skill mastery ability (see the rogue class feature) for that skill. Each morning, the illuminated monk may change the skill mastery he receives with meditative focus.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk''s bonus feat gained at 6th level.

Invisible Fist
Monks who follow the Path of the Invisible Fist learn to harness their ki to conceal themselves from detection. With further training, these monks learn to blink between the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane. To gain this versatility, they sacrifice their ability to escape unscathed from area effects.

Class: Monk.

Level: 2nd.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability, nor do you gain improved evasion at 9th level.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can become invisible for 1 round. You must wait 3 rounds before you can use this ability again.

At 9th level, as an immediate action, you can use blink, as the spell, for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round). You must wait 3 rounds before you can use this ability again.

Invisible fist is a supernatural ability.

Kalashtar Monk
The kalashtar monk uses his natural psionic ability to augment his combat prowess, allowing him to perform tasks beyond even a monk''s impressive abilities. Though they do not learn specific psionic powers, kalashtar monks channel their psionic talent in other ways.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a kalashtar monk substitution level, a character must be a kalashtar about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 7th level of monk.

Class Features
All the following are features of the kalashtar monk''s racial substitution levels. The kalashtar monk''s unarmed damage, AC bonus, and unarmored speed bonus all progress as for a standard monk.

Psychic Insight (Su): Once per round, a kalashtar monk can spend 1 power point as a swift action to gain a +1 insight bonus on the next grapple check or stunning fist attack roll he makes. The bonus lasts for up to 1 round and is lost if not used in that time.

As the monk gains levels, he can spend additional power points as part of the swift action (up to 2 power points at 5th level, and up to 3 at 11th level), with each power point spent increasing the insight bonus by 1.

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk''s flurry of blows ability. If the monk later gains an ability that improves his flurry of blows, that ability has no effect.

Bonus Feat: At 2nd level, a kalashtar monk can select any psionic feat as a bonus feat (provided he meets the normal prerequisites).

This substitution feature replaces the standard monk''s bonus feat gained at 2nd level.

Wholeness of Body (Su): A kalashtar monk of 7th level or higher can psionically augment the standard monk''s wholeness of body ability by spending 1 or more power points as part of the action used to activate it. Each power point spent heals an additional 1 point of damage.

Martial Monk
Some monks train as soldiers rather than as ascetic mystic warriors. These martial artists have a greater range of combat talents, but have less time to practice other skills.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: -1 skill point per level (and -4 skill points at 1st level); no Knowledge skills as class skills.

Gain: Fighter bonus feat list to choose monk bonus feats (at 1st, 2nd, and 6th level); Intimidate is class skill.

Purifying Flame (Su): A Phoenix Disciple can transform his ki into purifying fire. Once per round, a Phoenix Disciple can add 1d6 points of fire damage to any unarmed strike.

A Phoenix Disciple can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his monk level.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard 1st-level monk.

Resistance to Fire (Ex): At 3rd level, a Phoenix Disciple develops a minor tolerance for fire. He gains resistance to fire 5.

This benefit replaces the still mind class feature gained by a standard monk at 3rd level.

Your religious convictions protect you from the spells and magical abilities of those who oppose your beliefs.

Benefit: Your adherence to a religious path has developed in you a resistance to antithetical magic. You gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against spells and effects from chaotic-aligned creatures and creatures with a moral (good/evil) alignment component opposite to yours. This is a supernatural ability.


Planar Monk
Monks who travel the planes do so for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from seeking to restore an ancient artifact to their temple to a much more general quest for enlightenment. The magnificent diversity of the planes lead many monks to adventure, and few return to quiet monastic study without having spent at least some time exploring. Living out a classic paradox, most find both more and less than they anticipate.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a monk planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 5th, 13th, or 16th level of monk.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

Axiomatic Soul (Ex): At 13th level, a planar monk gains spell resistance equal to her class level +15. This spell resistance applies only to effects generated by chaotic outsiders.

This benefit replaces the diamond soul class feature gained by a standard monk at 13th level.

Ki Strike (Su): At 16th level, a planar monk''s unarmed attacks are treated as cold iron weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

This benefit replaces the ki strike (adamantine) class feature gained by a standard monk at 16th level.

Raging Monk
A monk who learns to master her inner fury is capable of channeling this into great physical power, although at the cost of some of her physical and mental grace.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Flurry of blows, still mind, greater flurry, quivering palm.

Gain: Rage. greater rage, mighty rage (all as barbarian).

Ex-Monk Options: If this character becomes chaotic and begins gaining levels of barbarian, she retains her monk rage abilities and can add her monk class levels to her barbarian levels to determine the number of times per day she can rage (as well as when she gains greater rage and mighty rage).

Sacred Strike
Sacred strike grants you greater flexibility in which creatures you can affect with your ki strike ability, allowing you to more effectively combat those who invoke your deity''s wrath.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain ki strike (magic) (or any later improvements to that class feature) or improved evasion.

Benefits: When you attack with your deity''s favored weapon you may make a special smite attack against the sworn enemies of your faith a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum once per day). Add your Charisma bonus (if any) to your attack roll and you deal 1 extra point of damage per monk level. If you smite a creature that is not an enemy of your faith, the smite has no effect and that use of the ability is spent.

Deity	Sworn Enemies
Heironeous	All evil creatures
Hextor	All good creatures
Moradin	All evil creatures
St. Cuthbert	All chaotic creatures
Wee Jas	All chaotic creatures
Yondalla	All evil creatures
Your sacred strike improves with your class level. At 10th level, your sacred strike deals damage as above and stuns an enemy of your faith for 1 round (Will save negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your monk level + your Wisdom modifier). At 16th level, your sacred strike can stuns an enemy of your faith for 1 round (Will save negates, DC 10 + 1/2 your monk level + your Wisdom modifier) and blinds that enemy for 1d8 rounds (no save for blindness effect). Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to the stunning and blinding effects.

Sidewinder Monk
The Order of the Sidewinder, a small and controversial order, is among the world''s strangest and least understood monastic organizations. Called sidewinder monks, those of this order imitate the attitudes of the deceptive snake from which they take their name.

The sidewinder monk is a variant monk. Unless otherwise noted, a sidewinder monk advances in the same manner as a monk (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of monk or sidewinder monk, she may not later take levels in the other class.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the sidewinder monk.

Bonus Feat: At 1st level, a sidewinder monk may select either Persuasive or Stealthy as a bonus feat. At 2nd level, she may take either Improved Feint or Mobility. At 6th level, she may choose either Improved Disarm or Improved Trip. She need not have any of the prerequisites normally required for these feats to select them.

Silver Tongue (Ex): From 2nd level, the sidewinder monk masters deception. Using false promises, empty threats, and personal magnetism, the monk gains a +1 competence bonus on all Bluff checks. This bonus increases by +1 at 4th level and every even numbered level thereafter.

Earthbound (Ex): The sidewinder monk develops an innate connection with the earth, granting her a +4 competence bonus on opposed Strength checks made to resist bull rush or overrun attempts.

Sneak Attack (Ex): At 3rd level the sidewinder monk gains the ability to sneak attack, as the rogue ability. Her bonus damage increases every three levels thereafter (+2d6 at 6th, +3d6 at 9th, and so on).

Fangs (Su): A 4th-level sidewinder monk can grow fangs and gain a bite attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage (1d3 for Small monks). She can grow her fangs once per day at 4th level and one additional time for every four levels thereafter. The fangs remain for a number of rounds equal to 1 + Constitution bonus (minimum one). This attack is made at her highest attack bonus. If made with a flurry of blows, the bite attack and all other flurry attacks suffer a -2 penalty.

At 15th level the sidewinder monk may, once per day, use her bite attack to instantly slay a living creature. The target of this attack must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 sidewinder monk levels + Constitution modifier) or die. This is a poison attack.

Intimidating Stance (Ex): By imitating the attitude and demeanor of a sidewinder, the sidewinder monk gains a +4 competence bonus on all Intimidate checks. This bonus improves to +6 when using her fang ability.

Soulwarp Strike
The traditional monk seeks balance in body, mind, and soul, and through this equilibrium gains various combat talents. A monk who learns the secret of the soulwarp strike masters an arcane talent of necromancy that infects her enemy''s ki, producing an effect akin to terrible sickness.

Class: Monk.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain the monk bonus feat normally acquired at 1st level.

Benefit: You know how to channel necromantic energy into your unarmed strikes. You must declare that you are using this ability before you make your attack roll (thus, a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). In addition to dealing its normal damage, your unarmed strike renders any living creature nauseated for 1 round, or sickened for 1 round if it succeeds on a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wis modifier).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your monk level, and no more than once per round. Creatures immune to necromancy effects (such as constructs) are unaffected by this ability.


Skarn Monk
A skarn monk takes his race''s dedication to "perfection of form" to great extremes, tuning his body, mind, and soul to extraordinary purity. As part of this perfection, he learns to channel incarnum to achieve various effects and also gains the ability to use his arm spines with tremendous effectiveness.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a skarn monk substitution level, a character must be a skarn about to take his 1st, 5th, or 10th level of monk.

Class Skills
Skarn monk substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard monk class, plus Intimidate.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All of the following are features of the skarn monk racial substitution levels.

Spine Strike (Ex): For all purposes related to monk class features, a skarn monk can treat his arm-spine attack as if it were an unarmed strike. This includes using it as part of a flurry of blows, ki strike, and the increased damage dealt by arm spines as the skarn monk gains levels (1d8 at 4th level, 1d10 at 8th level, and so forth).

This benefit replaces a standard monk''s unarmed strike class feature gained at 1st level.

Defensive Insight (Su): As a skarn monk becomes more in tune with the soul energy f lowing through his body, he learns to rely on this insight to aid his defense. Beginning at 5th level, a skarn monk gains a +1 insight bonus to AC for every point of essentia invested in this class feature. Insight bonuses to AC apply at all times, even against touch attacks or when a skarn monk is flat-footed, immobilized, or helpless. Wearing armor, carrying a shield, or carrying a medium or heavy load has no effect on this AC bonus.

A skarn monk gains 1 point of essentia at 5th level.

This benefit replaces a standard monk''s AC bonus gained at 5th level and improved every five levels thereafter. (A skarn monk still adds his Wisdom bonus to his AC.)

Shape Soulmeld (Su): A skarn monk''s perfection of body and soul is so strong that at 10th level, he gains the ability to shape a single soulmeld (as long as he has a Constitution score of 11 or higher). A skarn monk can shape this soulmeld each day, following the normal rules for meldshaping. This soulmeld must be chosen from the soulborn class list. A skarn monk''s meldshaper level is equal to one-half his monk level. The save DC (if any) for the soulmeld is equal to 10 + invested essentia + his Wis modifier.

This benefit replaces a standard monk''s ki strike (lawful) class feature gained at 10th level.

Chakra Bind (Arms): A skarn monk can bind a soulmeld (see above) to his arms chakra, following the normal rules for chakra binds.

Spell Reflection
Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator.

Class: Monk, ranger, rogue, or scout.

Level: 2nd (monk or rogue), 5th (scout), or 9th (ranger).

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain evasion. (If you would later gain improved evasion as a special ability, you gain evasion instead.)

Benefit: You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability.

For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a scorching ray, you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the scorching ray deals its normal damage to the wizard.

This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren''t subject to this reflection.

If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as scorching ray cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard''s scorching ray spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).

Standing Jump
While most monks gain a fluid grace that allows them to move with astounding speed, you have learned how to focus your energy and expel it in one quick burst.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, your fast movement ability is reduced. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to speed at 12th level and another +10-foot bonus at 18th level.

Benefit: At 3rd level, you can make a standing long jump with ease. The check DCs for your long jumps do not require a 20-foot running start and do not double when you leap from a standing position. At 6th level, you apply this skill to high jumps. The check DCs for your high jumps do not double when you leap from a standing position. You lose these benefits when wearing armor (even light armor) or when carrying a medium or heavy load.

Steadfast Monk
A monk might choose to give up some of her mobility in exchange for the ability to withstand attacks.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Enhancement bonus to unarmored speed, bonus to Armor Class when unarmored (retain Wisdom bonus to AC when unarmored).

Gain: Damage reduction (as barbarian).

Unwavering Dedication
Sacred enforcers are sometimes called upon to learn special techniques and abilities not taught to monks. You can ignore the multiclass restrictions of the monk for some classes.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this Class feature, you do not gain still mind.

Benefits: Taking levels in cleric, paladin, or blackguard (depending on your alignment) does not prevent you from taking monk levels. If you take levels in any other class, you lose your ability to progress as a monk as usual. Taking levels in monk does not prevent you from advancing as a paladin.

Vigilant Monk
A monk who can open her mind to a greater awareness gains the talent to identify her enemies more easily, but she gives up some of her inner peace.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Bonus feats at 2nd and 6th level, still mind.

Gain: Detect chaos (as paladin''s detect evil ability), uncanny dodge (as barbarian), improved uncanny dodge (as barbarian).

Wall Walker
You have the uncanny ability to travel along vertical surfaces for a short time.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the slow fall ability.

Benefit: Beginning at 4th level, as a move action, you can run up or down a vertical surface a total distance of 20 feet without making a Climb check. You add 10 feet to this distance at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, up to your maximum speed. You can use this ability only once per round (so you can''t make a double move up or down a wall).

If you do not reach the top of the vertical surface or find a suitable hand- or foothold, you must make a Climb check appropriate to the surface. If you succeed on the check, you can use this ability again in the next round. Otherwise, you fall or make no progress, as determined by the check result.

You can''t use this ability to traverse a ceiling or overhang.

Weapon Proficiencies
The standard monk uses a set of weapons most commonly seen in traditional Okinawan and Japanese martial arts systems. The sai and kama, in particular, are often associated with the fighting methods of those island nations, while weapons like the quarterstaff are more widely used and practiced throughout the world. Many other fighting styles and cultures exist worldwide, and not all monks must practice the same martial arts. If your monk wants something a little different, try one of these real-world fighting styles from Southeast Asia.

THE GHURKA
Since the early 1800s, members of this Nepalese tribe have served as special forces for the British military. Noted for their stealth and ferocity in battle, the Ghurka earned great fame for themselves and their weapon of choice, the kukri. The kukri is a common tool for these people, and many children as young as five years old receive one. As the child grows, he develops great skill with the kukri, since it is used for everything from cutting wood to skinning game.

In a D&D campaign, the Ghurka (or a similar tribe) might be special agents of a great empire, or just a small but deadly tribe hidden in a faraway mountain jungle. Many of the tribesmen could be rangers or barbarians, but monks represent the true masters of their fighting art.

A Ghurka monk loses proficiency in the kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, and siangham and gains proficiency in the kukri, short sword (some kukri are quite large), and short bow. The Ghurka monk uses the kukri, short sword, and club as special monk weapons.

ARNIS, KALI, ESCRIMA
These three terms refer to a wide variety of Filipino martial arts systems. Each has a long and unique history, and detailing each art is far beyond the scope of this article. They do share certain common traits and training methods that can be applied to the monk class.

Filipino martial culture makes extensive use of the knife, and some Filipinos carry a blade from an early age. Classical Filipino martial arts use blades as short as daggers or as large as longswords. During training, short sticks are often used as a substitute for blades and many Filipino masters are as dangerous with a stick as they are with a blade. Many of these styles teach the use of these weapons in pairs, a tactic than can be represented with the Two-Weapon Fighting feat in D&D.

Monks trained in Filipino martial arts lose proficiency in the kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, and siangham but gain proficiency in the short sword, longsword, and whip. Monks using this style count the club, dagger, quarterstaff, and short sword as their special monk weapons.

KRABI-KRABONG
Movies and kickboxing competitions have helped to popularize the art of Muay Thai, but Krabi-Krabong - a Thai weapons-based art - is less well known. The art is considered by some to be a predecessor of Muay Thai, and it utilizes many of the same powerful kicks, elbow, and knee strikes that Muay Thai is famous for. Thai culture is strongly Buddhist, and Krabi-Krabong incorporates many Buddhist rituals and beliefs into its training.

Krabi-Krabong teaches the use of five weapons and three types of shields. The weapons include the daab, a heavy curved sword often used in pairs (a technique referred to as Daab Song Muun); the krabi, a short saber; the krabong, a long bamboo staff; the mae sun sowks, a tonfa-like weapon also used in pairs; and the ngao (spear). The shields consist of the dung (long shield), kaen (medium shield), and loh (round shield). Techniques are often practiced with live blades, so students must learn control as well as power and timing.

In place of the kama, nunchaku, sai, shuriken, and siangham, monks trained in Krabi-Krabong learn the short sword, spear, and short spear and treat all those weapons as special monk weapons (as well as the club and quarterstaff). They also gain proficiency with all shields except tower shields, although they do not gain additional armor proficiency.

Wholeness of Others
Like their cleric brethren, sacred enforcers frequently look beyond themselves to the safety and well-being of others. Although they tend to work alone, some sacred enforcers like to travel with companions. These sacred enforcers learn the secret ki techniques necessary to heal the wounds of others.

Level: 7th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wholeness of body.

Benefits: You can heal the wounds of others with a touch. You can heal a number of hit points of damage equal to twice your current class level each day, and you can spread this healing out among several uses and recipients. Each use is a standard action. You may not heal yourself with this ability.

Wild Monk
The wild monk attains perfection by embracing the natural order. She learns from the ebb and flow of the seasons and the living land. She imitates the ways of animals - how they move, how they fight, and how they find their places in the world. As the wild monk grows in power, she assumes a number of druidic abilities.

Wild monks do not congregate in monasteries as do normal monks. Instead, they gather in small communities, often in sacred or otherwise special natural locales. If they share territory with druids, wild monk communities usually stay on good terms with them. Like rangers. many wild monks serve with druids and aid them in defending nature. Although they often worship gods of nature or nature itself, some wild monks also revere tribal deities or the lawful deities of normal monks.

The wild monk is a variant monk. Unless otherwise noted, a wild monk advances in the same manner as a monk (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of monk or wild monk, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level monk twice.

Alignment: Wild monks must adhere to the discipline of the natural order. They may only be lawful neutral.

Class Skills
The wild monk''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Balance (Dex), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Tumble (Dex).

Class Features
The wild monk trades several monk class features for druid abilities as noted on the level progression table. The wild monk may freely multiclass with the druid class. If the character chooses any other multiclass option, she may not gain any more wild monk levels.

Resist Nature''s Lure (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, the wild monk gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Wild Shape (Su): At 6th level, the wild monk gains the ability to turn herself into any Small or Medium animal and back again once per day. This ability works exactly as the druid ability of the same name. The wild monk can use this ability more times per day at 8th, 10th, 14th, 18th, and 20th level, as noted on the wild monk advancement table. In addition, she gains the ability to take the shape of a Large animal at 12th level, a Tiny animal at 15th level, and a Huge animal at 16th level. At 19th level, the wild monk becomes able to use wild shape to change into a Small, Medium, or Large elemental once per day.

If a character has levels in both wild monk and druid, the wild shape abilities of each class act independently of the other. Thus, an 11th-level druid/9th-level wild monk could wild shape four times per day as a druid and take the form of any Tiny, Small, Medium, or Large animal, and she could wild shape twice per day as a wild monk and take the form of any Small or Medium animal.',

SET 
    description = 'The compassion to pursue good, the will to uphold law, and the power to defeat evil - these are the three weapons of the paladin. Few have the purity and devotion that it takes to walk the paladin''s path, but those few are rewarded with the power to protect, to heal, and to smite. In a land of scheming wizards, unholy priests, bloodthirsty dragons, and infernal fiends, the paladin is the final hope that cannot be extinguished.

Paladins take their adventures seriously and have a penchant for referring to them as quests. Even a mundane mission is, in the heart of the paladin, a personal test - an opportunity to demonstrate bravery, to develop martial skills, to learn tactics, and to find ways to do good. Still, the paladin really comes into her own when leading a mighty campaign against evil, not when merely looting ruins.

Divine power protects the paladin and gives her special powers. It wards off harm, protects her from disease, lets her heal herself, and guards her heart against fear. The paladin can also direct this power to help others, healing their wounds or curing diseases. Finally, the paladin can use this power to destroy evil. Even the least experienced paladin can detect evil, and more experienced paladins can smite evil foes and turn away undead. In addition, this power draws a mighty steed to the paladin and imbues that mount with strength, intelligence, and magical protection.

Paladins must be lawful good, and they lose their divine powers if they deviate from that alignment. Additionally, paladins swear to follow a code of conduct that is in line with lawfulness and goodness.

Paladins need not devote themselves to a single deity - devotion to righteousness is enough. Those who align themselves with particular religions prefer Heironeous (god of valor) over all others, but some paladins follow Pelor (the sun god). Paladins devoted to a god are scrupulous in observing religious duties and are welcome in every associated temple.

No one ever chooses to be a paladin. Becoming a paladin is answering a call, accepting one''s destiny. No one, no matter how diligent, can become a paladin through practice. The nature is either within one or not, and it is not possible to gain the paladin''s nature by any act of will. It is possible, however, to fail to recognize one''s own potential, or to deny one''s destiny. Occasionally, one who is called to be a paladin denies that call and pursues some other life instead.

Most paladins answer the call and begin training as adolescents. Typically, they become squires or assistants to experienced paladins, train for years, and finally set off on their own to further the causes of good and law. Other paladins, however, find their calling only later in life, after having pursued some other career. All paladins, regardless of background, recognize in each other an eternal bond that transcends culture, race, and even religion. Any two paladins, even from opposite sides of the world, consider themselves comrades.

Humans, with their ambitious souls, make great paladins. Half-elves, who often have human ambition, may also find themselves called into service as paladins. Dwarves are sometimes paladins, but becoming a paladin may be hard on a dwarf because it means putting the duties of the paladin''s life before duties to family, clan, and king. Elf paladins are few, and they tend to follow quests that take them far and wide because their lawful bent puts them out of synch with life among the elves. Members of the other common races rarely hear the call to become paladins. Among the savage humanoids, paladins are all but unheard of.

Even though paladins are in some ways set apart from others, they eagerly team up with those whose skills and capabilities complement their own. They work well with good and lawful clerics, and they appreciate working with those who are brave, honest, and committed to good. While they cannot abide evil acts by their companions, they are otherwise willing to work with a variety of people quite different from themselves. Charismatic, trustworthy, and well respected, the paladin makes a fine leader for a team.

The paladin''s chief role in most groups is as a melee combatant, but she contributes other useful support as well. She makes a good secondary healer, and her high Charisma opens up fine leadership opportunities.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the paladin.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Good (Ex): The power of a paladin''s aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to her paladin level.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a paladin can use detect evil, as the spell.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, a paladin may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to her attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per paladin level. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.

At 5th level, and at every five levels thereafter, the paladin may smite evil one additional time per day, as indicated on Table: The Paladin, to a maximum of five times per day at 20th level.

Divine Grace (Su): At 2nd level, a paladin gains a bonus equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) on all saving throws.

Lay on Hands (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. Each day she can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. A paladin may choose to divide her healing among multiple recipients, and she doesn''t have to use it all at once. Using lay on hands is a standard action.

Alternatively, a paladin can use any or all of this healing power to deal damage to undead creatures. Using lay on hands in this way requires a successful melee touch attack and doesn''t provoke an attack of opportunity. The paladin decides how many of her daily allotment of points to use as damage after successfully touching an undead creature.

Aura of Courage (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). Each ally within 10 feet of her gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead.

Divine Health (Ex): At 3rd level, a paladin gains immunity to all diseases, including supernatural and magical diseases.

Turn Undead (Su): When a paladin reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead. She may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. She turns undead as a cleric of three levels lower would.

Spells: Beginning at 4th level, a paladin gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the paladin spell list. A paladin must choose and prepare her spells in advance.

To prepare or cast a spell, a paladin must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a paladin''s spell is 10 + the spell level + the paladin''s Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a paladin can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Paladin. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Paladin indicates that the paladin gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, she gains only the bonus spells she would be entitled to based on her Wisdom score for that spell level The paladin does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.

A paladin prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though she cannot lose a prepared spell to spontaneously cast a cure spell in its place. A paladin may prepare and cast any spell on the paladin spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a paladin has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, her caster level is one-half her paladin level.

Special Mount (Sp): Upon reaching 5th level, a paladin gains the service of an unusually intelligent, strong, and loyal steed to serve her in her crusade against evil (see below). This mount is usually a heavy warhorse (for a Medium paladin) or a warpony (for a Small paladin).

Once per day, as a full-round action, a paladin may magically call her mount from the celestial realms in which it resides. This ability is the equivalent of a spell of a level equal to one-third the paladin''s class level. The mount immediately appears adjacent to the paladin and remains for 2 hours per paladin level; it may be dismissed at any time as a free action. The mount is the same creature each time it is summoned, though the paladin may release a particular mount from service.

Each time the mount is called, it appears in full health, regardless of any damage it may have taken previously. The mount also appears wearing or carrying any gear it had when it was last dismissed. Calling a mount is a conjuration (calling) effect.

Should the paladin''s mount die, it immediately disappears, leaving behind any equipment it was carrying. The paladin may not summon another mount for thirty days or until she gains a paladin level, whichever comes first, even if the mount is somehow returned from the dead. During this thirty-day period, the paladin takes a -1 penalty on attack and weapon damage rolls.

Remove Disease (Sp): At 6th level, a paladin can produce a remove disease effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).

Code of Conduct
A paladin must be of lawful good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin''s code requires that she respect legitimate authority, act with honor (not lying, not cheating, not using poison, and so forth), help those in need (provided they do not use the help for evil or chaotic ends), and punish those who harm or threaten innocents.

Associates
While she may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful good.

Ex-Paladins
A paladin who ceases to be lawful good, who willfully commits an evil act, or who grossly violates the code of conduct loses all paladin spells and abilities (including the service of the paladin''s mount, but not weapon, armor, and shield proficiencies). She may not progress any farther in levels as a paladin. She regains her abilities and advancement potential if she atones for her violations (see the atonement spell description), as appropriate.

Like a member of any other class, a paladin may be a multiclass character, but multiclass paladins face a special restriction. A paladin who gains a level in any class other than paladin may never again raise her paladin level, though she retains all her paladin abilities.

THE PALADIN''S MOUNT
The paladin''s mount is superior to a normal mount of its kind and has special powers, as described below. The standard mount for a Medium paladin is a heavy warhorse, and the standard mount for a Small paladin is a warpony. Another kind of mount, such as a riding dog (for a halfling paladin) or a Large shark (for a paladin in an aquatic campaign) may be allowed as well. A paladin''s mount is treated as a magical beast, not an animal, for the purpose of all effects that depend on its type (though it retains an animal''s HD, base attack bonus, saves, skill points, and feats).

Paladin Level	Bonus HD	Natural Armor Adj.	Str Adj.	Int	Special
5th-7th	+2	+4	+1	6	Empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, share saving throws
8th-10th	+4	+6	+2	7	Improved speed
11th-14th	+6	+8	+3	8	Command creatures of its kind
15th-20th	+8	+10	+4	9	Spell resistance
Paladin''s Mount Basics: Use the base statistics for a creature of the mount''s kind, but make changes to take into account the attributes and characteristics summarized on the table and described below.

Bonus HD: Extra eight-sided (d8) Hit Dice, each of which gains a Constitution modifier, as normal. Extra Hit Dice improve the mount''s base attack and base save bonuses. A special mount''s base attack bonus is equal to that of a cleric of a level equal to the mount''s HD. A mount has good Fortitude and Reflex saves (treat it as a character whose level equals the animal''s HD). The mount gains additional skill points or feats for bonus HD as normal for advancing a monster''s Hit Dice.

Natural Armor Adj.: The number on the table is an improvement to the mount''s existing natural armor bonus.

Str Adj.: Add this figure to the mount''s Strength score.

Int: The mount''s Intelligence score.

Empathic Link (Su): The paladin has an empathic link with her mount out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The paladin cannot see through the mount''s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Note that even intelligent mounts see the world differently from humans, so misunderstandings are always possible.

Because of this empathic link, the paladin has the same connection to an item or place that her mount does, just as with a master and his familiar (see Familiars).

Improved Evasion (Ex): When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a mount takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage if the saving throw fails.

Share Spells: At the paladin''s option, she may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) she casts on herself also affect her mount. The mount must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the mount if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the mount again even if it returns to the paladin before the duration expires. Additionally, the paladin may cast a spell with a target of “You” on her mount (as a touch range spell) instead of on herself. A paladin and her mount can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the mount''s type (magical beast).

Share Saving Throws: For each of its saving throws, the mount uses its own base save bonus or the paladin''s, whichever is higher. The mount applies its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn''t share any other bonuses on saves that the master might have.

Improved Speed (Ex): The mount''s speed increases by 10 feet.

Command (Sp): Once per day per two paladin levels of its master, a mount can use this ability to command other any normal animal of approximately the same kind as itself (for warhorses and warponies, this category includes donkeys, mules, and ponies), as long as the target creature has fewer Hit Dice than the mount. This ability functions like the command spell, but the mount must make a DC 21 Concentration check to succeed if it''s being ridden at the time. If the check fails, the ability does not work that time, but it still counts against the mount''s daily uses. Each target may attempt a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin''s level + paladin''s Cha modifier) to negate the effect.

Spell Resistance (Ex): A mount''s spell resistance equals its master''s paladin level + 5. To affect the mount with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the mount''s spell resistance.

Anarch
The anarch is a holy warrior tasked with opposing law and order and encouraging others to do the same. He is a roving force of chaos, never remaining in one location for long but leaving his mark in the form of mayhem wherever he goes. Some anarchs profess that chaos is the ultimate freedom. Others claim that change is the natural state of the world. Few anarchs view their holy mission in the same way, and most change their opinion many times.

Anarchs must be chaotic neutral, since they embody the unpredictable nature of entropy. Chaotic deities of war and destruction often have anarchs serving their needs, even if the chaotic nature of the anarch is sometimes at odds with the goals of the god''s followers. Anarchs do not form knighthoods or similar societies; they work alone or in small groups. Two anarchs are just as likely to come into conflict with one another as they are to work together for a common goal.

Alignment: Chaotic neutral.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The anarch''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Disable Device (Int), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (architecture and engineering) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Sense Motive (Wis), and Survival (Wis).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the anarch.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Anarchs are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Chaos: The power of an anarch''s aura of chaos (see the detect chaos spell) is equal to his anarch level.

Detect Law (Sp): At will, an anarch can use detect law, as the spell.

Smite Law (Su): An anarch''s smite ability affects lawful creatures, but otherwise, it functions the same as the paladin''s ability to smite evil.

Divine Grace (Su): An anarch gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Destructive Strike (Su): A 2nd-level anarch gains the ability to critically hit objects and constructs with melee attacks. He may inflict critical hit damage (but not sneak attack damage) on an object or construct a number of times per day equal to his Charisma modifier. The anarch makes the decision to use this ability after a critical hit is rolled but before the roll to confirm is made. If the anarch fails to confirm the critical hit, that use of destructive strike is wasted.

Aura of Courage (Su): An anarch gains this ability at 3rd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Slippery Mind (Ex): The anarch has a powerful sense self and free will, and his mind fights much harder against magical control than most other minds. If an anarch is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails his saving throw, he can attempt the saving throw again 1 round later to break free of the effect. Failing this second saving throw does not grant the anarch further saving throws against the enchantment.

Turn Construct (Su): When an anarch reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to turn or destroy constructs. The anarch can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The anarch turns constructs as a cleric three levels lower would turn undead.

Special Mount (Sp): Anarchs gain a special mount, just as a paladin does, at 5th level.

Dispel Law (Sp): At 8th level, an anarch gains the ability to dispel law, as the spell, once per week. He may use this ability an additional time each week every additional four levels, to a maximum of 4 times a week at 20th level. Caster level is equal to the anarch''s class level.

Code of Conduct
An anarch must be of chaotic neutral alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a blatantly lawful act (such as abiding by an oath, fulfilling a contract, or joining an organization such as a brotherhood or fellowship). Aside from this, the anarch''s code is really little more than a lack of code. As long as he continues to cause chaos and foment disrespect for law in others, his status as anarch is secure.

Associates
An anarch never knowingly associates with lawful characters, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. An anarch can accept only henchmen, familiars, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic neutral.

Anarch Spell List
Anarchs choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Bane, bless weapon, cause fear, cure light wounds, detect poison, divine favor, doom, endure elements, entropic shield, lesser confusion, magic weapon, obscuring mist, protection from law.

2nd Level: Align weapon, bear''s endurance, blur, darkness, eagle''s splendor, mirror image, misdirection, scare, shatter, touch of idiocy, undetectable alignment.

3rd Level: Blindness/deafness, contagion, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, magic circle against law, rage, slow.

4th Level: Break enchantment, chaos hammer, confusion, cure serious wounds, dispel law, freedom of movement, lesser planar ally, poison, shout.

Angel''s Sight
You are blessed with the ability to see as celestials do.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: if you choose this ability, you do not gain divine health.

Benefit: You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet and low-light vision. If you already have one of these senses, you gain no additional bonus from this ability.

Anti-Paladin
Of the variant unholy warriors, the anti-paladin is certainly the most notorious. A loner, he eschews prolonged contact with all forms of society and companionship except on a temporary basis as his desires, needs, and lusts demand. He wanders the fringe of civilization, always seeking justice to upend, happiness to quash, and faith to destroy. Many anti-paladins are truly mad, completely overwhelmed with the burning desire to tear down what others have toiled to create, be it a comfortable home, a loving family, or even a powerful nation.

Anti-paladins must be chaotic evil, since they personify the raw destructive force of entropy and hatred without focus or direction. Evil deities of destruction often count anti-paladins among their devoted, but powerful beings from the lower planes (especially demon lords) also enlist these hateful souls as minions. Anti-paladins do not form knighthoods or similar societies, but they do work as mercenaries. An anti-paladin who finds himself in charge of a contingent of like-minded killers usually grows tired of his "allies" before long and leads them to their doom or kills them himself.

Alignment: Chaotic evil.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The anti-paladin''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Ride (Dex), and Survival (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the anti-paladin.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Anti-paladins are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Evil: The power of an anti-paladin''s aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to his anti-paladin level.

Detect Good (Sp): At will, an anti-paladin can detect good, as the spell.

Smite Good (Su): An anti-paladin''s smite targets creatures of a good alignment, but otherwise, it functions the same as the paladin''s ability to smite evil.

Divine Grace (Su): An anti-paladin gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Slaughter the Weak (Ex): Beginning at 2nd level, an anti-paladin takes a perverse and horrendous glee when facing opponents in battle that are weaker than himself. He gains a +2 morale bonus to attack and damage rolls with melee weapons when he attacks any creature that has fewer Hit Dice than he does. Dying creatures who have less Hit Dice than the anti-paladin suffer a -2 penalty to save against death knell spells cast by the anti-paladin.

Aura of Fear (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, an anti-paladin exudes an almost palpable aura of menace and evil. Each enemy within 10 feet of her suffers a -4 morale penalty on saving throws against fear effects. The anti-paladin herself is deadened to the emotion of fear, and is immune to all fear effects. This ability functions while the anti-paladin is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead. An anti-paladin can suppress or activate this aura as a free action.

Death Knell (Sp): The anti-paladin can cast death knell, as the spell, once per day at 3rd level, at a caster level equal to his anti-paladin level. At every five levels thereafter the anti-paladin can cast death knell an additional time each day.

Turn or Rebuke Outsider (Su): When an anti-paladin reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to turn or destroy good outsiders by channeling energy. He can instead rebuke or command evil outsiders with a use of this ability if he chooses. The anti-paladin may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The anti-paladin turns or rebukes outsiders as a cleric of three levels lower would turn undead.

Fiendish Mount (Sp): Anti-paladins gain a fiendish mount at 5th level. This ability functions just like the special mount ability of the paladin class except that an anti-paladin''s special mount always has the fiendish template, and it remains for 1 hour per anti-paladin level once called.

Contagion (Sp): At 6th level, an anti-paladin gains the ability to cast contagion, as the spell, once per week. He may use this ability an additional time each week every additional three levels, to a maximum of 5 times a week at 20th level. Caster level is equal to the anti-paladin''s class level.

Code of Conduct
An anti-paladin must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a good act. He must work at all times to undermine the works of civilization and good peoples, and must never offer mercy or grant quarter unless he betrays his word within the next hour. He cannot join an organization, but he can perform services for others as long as the services are for pay and ultimately lead to chaos and devastation.

Associates
An anti-paladin may adventure with any non-good alignment, but remains hateful and distrustful of any "allies." As soon as an ally is no longer useful, the anti-paladin usually kills her (or at the very least, sacrifices her for his own personal gain). He never knowingly associates with good characters, nor will he continue an association with someone who balks at senseless murder or refuses to reward him for his aid. An anti-paladin may only accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic evil. Anti-paladins always suffer the -2 penalty for cruelty when determining their effective Leadership score to recruit a cohort.

Anti-Paladin Spell List
Anti-paladins choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Bane, cause fear, curse water, deathwatch, doom, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, profane weapon, protection from good, protection from law, ray of enfeeblement, read magic, summon monster I.

2nd Level: Bull''s strength, darkness, desecrate, shatter, summon monster II, undetectable alignment.

3rd Level: Bestow curse, blindness/deafness, deeper darkness, greater magic weapon, heal mount, inflict moderate wounds, magic circle against good, magic circle against law, summon monster III.

4th Level: Death ward, dispel good, dispel law, fear, inflict serious wounds, poison, unholy sword.

Aura of Banishment
An invisible aura surrounds you that prevents fiends from extraplanar travel onto your plane.

Level: 6th.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the ability to remove disease.

Benefit: An aura of banishment surrounds you to a distance of 30 feet. Only evil outsiders can feel the aura and suffer from its effects. No evil outsider with fewer Hit Dice than your paladin level can be summoned into this area, nor can such creatures use summoning or teleporting effects.

In addition, the aura grants you a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks against evil outsiders.

Aura of Sanctity
A sacred ritual conducted with a group of archons has left you with otherworldly protection.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the ability to turn undead.

Benefit: Choose one of the following effects: compulsion effects (including possession), death effects, petrification. You are immune to that effect. Allies within your aura of courage gain a +4 bonus on saves versus your chosen effect.

Avenger
The avenger is a guardian of the downtrodden and a champion of the victims of the world. She is a loner, wandering from town to town in constant search of wrongs to right and oppressive dictators and rulers to overthrow. Yet despite the avenger''s obsession with vengeance and punishment of those who do evil to others, she is not a cruel or sadistic person. She aims to temper her acts of vengeance so that the punishment fits the crime. Execution is a punishment of last resort, reserved only for the truly evil and despicable.

Avengers must be chaotic good. They usually serve deities that value personal freedom or vengeance. Avengers prefer to work alone and form groups with other avengers only for brief missions. They prefer to keep their faith personal and generally look down upon organized religious worship. To an avenger, a deity is best served by action than by lip service.

Aligment: Chaotic good.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The avenger''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (local) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Move Silently (Dex), Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the avenger.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Avengers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Chaos: The power of an avenger''s aura of chaos (see the detect chaos spell) is equal to his avenger level.

Detect Law (Sp): At will, an avenger can detect law, as the spell.

Smite Law (Su): An avenger''s smite targets creatures with a lawful alignment, but otherwise, it functions the same as the paladin''s ability to smite evil.

Divine Grace (Su): An avenger gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Lay on Hands (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, an avenger with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can heal wounds (her own or those of others) by touch. This ability is otherwise the same as the paladin ability of the same name.

Aura of Courage (Su): An avenger gains this ability at 3rd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Slippery Mind (Ex): The avenger has a powerful sense of self and free will, and her mind fights much harder against magical control than most other minds. If an avenger is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt the saving throw again 1 round later to break free of the effect. Failing this second saving throw does not grant the anarch further saving throws against the enchantment.

Turn Undead (Su): When an avenger reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to turn undead just like a paladin.

Animal Minion (Su): At 5th level, avengers gain an animal minion that can serve as a scout, a combatant, or a guardian. Most avengers select some form of bird as their minion. The animal minion must be equal in size or smaller than the avenger''s size, since they are never used as mounts. This animal minion is otherwise treated as a paladin''s special mount in all ways, including additional abilities gained as the avenger gains levels and the repercussions if the minion is lost.

Break Enchantment (Sp): At 6th level, an avenger can cast break enchantment as a spell-like ability once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at gth, three times at 12th, and so forth).

Code of Conduct
An avenger must be of chaotic good alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an evil act or willingly allies with a lawful government or affiliated agency. While the avenger''s life is based around achieving vengeance and retribution for the oppressed and downtrodden, she must temper this vengeance appropriately. Killing should be the last resort of the avenger when a more appropriate and less destructive form of vengeance will do, and even then, slaying an oppressor should be reserved only for the most evil villains. Avengers must aid and assist anyone who asks for help (within reason) and must not join any organized association, order, or group. She may attend the services of her church but is encouraged to worship in private.

Associates
An avenger may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment. Although she can associate with lawful characters for a limited time, she will never knowingly associate with evil characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. An avenger can accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic good.

Avenger Spell List
Avengers choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Bless, bless water, bless weapon, disguise self, cure light wounds, detect poison, divine favor, endure elements, lesser restoration, magic stone, magic weapon, mending, protection from evil, protection from law, read magic, shield of faith.

2nd Level: Align weapon, alter self, cat''s grace, cure moderate wounds, eagle''s splendor, fox''s cunning, invisibility, make whole, misdirection, resist energy, shield other, undetectable alignment.

3rd Level: Cure moderate wounds, dispel magic, flame arrow, greater magic weapon, magic vestment, magic circle against evil, magic circle against law, nondetection. obscure object.

4th Level: Cure serious wounds, detect scrying, dispel law, dispel evil, freedom of movement, greater invisibility, holy sword, neutralize poison, restoration. stone shape.


Berronar Valkyrie
Berronar''s Valkyries are female dwarf paladins of the goddess Berronar Truesilver. They study tactics and charge into battle to save male dwarf warriors. Their special powers help them look after their allies and punish oathbreakers.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Berronar Valkyrie paladin substitution level, a character must be a female dwarf, have Berronar as her patron deity, be a member of the Berronar''s Valkyries order, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Berronar Valkyrie paladin substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Berronar Valkyrie substitution levels.

Everbright Blessing (Su): Starting at 3rd level, a Valkyrie''s armor, shield, and primary weapon are treated as if they had the everbright special ability; they shine like polished silver, they are immune to acid and rust attacks, and the armor provides her with resistance to acid 5. This ability only applies to the items the Valkyrie is wearing; if the items are removed or dropped, they lose this property until she picks them up again.

This benefit replaces the divine health class feature gained by a standard paladin at 3rd level.

Valiant Rescue (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a Valkyrie gains a special ability to charge into harm''s way to protect an ally. A Valkyrie can charge into melee with a creature that threatens one of her allies and still make a full attack with a single melee weapon rather than a single attack. During this charge she acts as if she had the Mobility feat; if she is mounted, this bonus also applies to her mount.

A Valkyrie can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces the turn undead class feature gained by a standard paladin at 4th level.

Binding Oath (Su): At 6th level, a Valkyrie gains the ability to magically link two willing individuals making an oath (or a legal agreement). This link has two effects. First, it informs both parties and the Valkyrie instantly if the oath is broken in any way. Second, the individual who breaks the oath is fatigued for one day per paladin level of the Valkyrie at the time of the oath-binding.

A Valkyrie can bind an oath once per week as a full-round action. For every three paladin levels gained thereafter, the Valkyrie can use this ability one extra time per week (2/week at 9th level, 3/week at 12th level, and so forth).

This benefit replaces the remove disease class feature gained by a standard paladin at 6th level. A Berronar Valkyrie who selects this substitution level never gains the remove disease ability.

Touch of Fatigue (Sp): Beginning at 6th level, a Valkyrie can use touch of fatigue at will. This ability is normally used to admonish those about to stray from their promises or to punish those guilty of minor infractions. The save DC against this spell-like ability is 10 + the Valkyrie''s Charisma modifier.

Charging Smite
Despite the glorious vision of a shining knight atop a warhorse charging into combat, the reality in the D&D game is that it''s far from easy (and sometimes impossible) to bring a big animal along on your dungeon crawl. To avoid the drain on time and resources created by a special mount you might not even be able to use, you can select the charging smite alternative class feature instead. You still leap into the fray, taking the fight to the enemy, but you do so in a manner that better matches the typical combat found in a D&D game.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a special mount.

Benefit: Beginning at 5th level, if you smite evil on a charge attack, you deal an extra 2 points of damage per paladin level to any evil creature you hit (in addition to the normal bonus damage dealt by a smite). If the charge attack misses, the smite ability is not considered used. This is a supernatural ability.

Claw of the Sun and the Ankh
The first Mulhorandi order of paladins to worship a god other than Osiris, the Claw of the Sun and the Ankh serves Horus-Re. Its fearless and fanatical soldiers are dedicated to energetically pursing the evil minions of Set, relentlessly destroying them and their foul plans whenever they are found.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Claw of the Sun and the Ankh substitution level, a character must have Horus-Re as his patron deity, be a member of the Claws of the Sun and the Ankh order, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 1st, 6th, or 12th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Claw of the Sun and the Ankh substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Claw of the Sun and the Ankh substitution levels.

Bird of Prey (Su): Beginning at 1st level, once per day a Claw of the Sun and the Ankh can pay homage to his god by taking on aspects of a hawk. His hands turn into claws that deal 1d4 points of damage; the attacks deal extra damage equal to one-half his paladin level to evil creatures. These attacks are considered magic, good-aligned weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. The paladin is considered to be proficient with these natural weapons while using this form. This transformation lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.

At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, a Claw of the Sun and the Ankh can use this ability one extra time per day.

This benefit replaces the smite evil class feature gained by a standard paladin. A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh never gains any smite evil attacks at later levels.

Smite Minions of Set (Su): A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh is tasked with eliminating members of the church of Set. Starting at 6th level he can use a melee attack to attempt to smite a creature that has Set as its patron deity. This otherwise functions as the paladin''s normal smite evil class feature.

A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh can use this smite attack once per day, plus one extra time per day for every three levels gained beyond 6th.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s remove disease class feature. A Claw of the Sun and the Ankh who selects this substitution level never gains the remove disease ability.

Horus-Re''s Glory (Su): Starting at 12th level, a Claw''s armor shines brightly (as the daylight spell). This illumination can be suppressed or resumed at will with a standard action.

This benefit replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard paladin at 12th level. From this point forward, a Claw of the Sun and the Ankh who selects this substitution level can prepare one less 3rd-level paladin spell than normal.

Corrupter
Of the three unholy warriors, none can match the corrupter in his capacity for evil. The despot serves as a guardian to those he oppresses and abuses, and the anti-paladin is often too self-destructive and capricious to be a long-term menace. Additionally, their goals are often focused on large scales, and as such their evil is blatantly obvious. The corrupter, on the other hand, specializes in smaller scale perversions and cruelties. He may not rule nations or drive his enemies before himself with waves of fear, but the effects of his deeds are arguably more terrifying. The corrupter is a hidden evil, a lurking menace that uses charm, guile, and deception to allow his evil to work like a slow poison in the souls of his victims.

The corrupter''s primary focus is to corrupt the faith of others; his favored targets are good clerics, He uses the abilities granted by his deity to infiltrate the churches of other gods, usually in the guise of a mercenary looking to add purpose to his life in the form of newfound faith. Once he has corrupted as many priests as possible, but before he is discovered, he moves on to a new church. Another favorite tactic is to quietly slay the enemy clerics in a settlement so that minions of his own faith can fill the void left by their passing; often, a town readily accepts the arrival of a new band of clerics when the previous ones have mysteriously been slain.

Corrupters are always neutral evil; they ignore the laws of the land as they see fit to work their evil, yet must remain focused and true to their own deities. All evil deities count at least a few corrupters among their faithful, although most worship deities of deception and temptation. A corrupter''s faith in his deity is absolute; he sees himself as a personal extension of his patron''s will and strives to undo the work of all other faiths. While he does his best to survive in the wake of his anguished victims, he never hesitates to make great personal sacrifices in order to ensure the success of his hateful goals.

Alignment: Neutral evil.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The corrupter''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disguise (Cha), Forgery (Int), Hide (Dex), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the corrupter.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Corrupters are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Evil: The power of a corrupter''s aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to his corrupter level.

Detect Good (Sp): At will, a corrupter can detect good, as the spell.

Smite Heathen (Su): A corrupter''s smite targets all creatures with the ability (including potential ability, such as a paladin or ranger who have yet to progress to a level that allows spellcasting) to cast divine spells, with the exception of worshipers of his own faith. Otherwise, it functions the same as the paladin''s ability to smite evil.

Divine Grace (Su): A corrupter gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Hidden Faith (Su): A corrupter''s faith in his deity becomes hidden when he reaches 2nd level. He gains a +4 profane bonus to all Bluff, Disguise, and Forgery checks to maintain this deception, and any magical attempt to discern his actual faith fails unless the caster makes a successful level check (DC = the target''s corrupter levels + 10).

Aura of Fear (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a corrupter exudes an almost palpable aura of menace and evil. Each enemy within 10 feet of him suffers a -4 morale penalty on saving throws against fear effects. The corrupter himself is deadened to the emotion of fear, and is immune to all fear effects. This ability functions while the corrupter is conscious, but not if he is unconscious or dead. A corrupter can suppress or activate this aura as a free action.

Disguise Self (Sp): At 3rd level, a corrupter can cast disguise self, as the spell. He may use this spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to his Charisma bonus (minimum of once per day), at a caster level equal to his corrupter level.

Intercession (Su): When a corrupter reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to cut divine spellcasters off from their source of power. To do so, the corrupter makes a turning check as a cleric three levels lower would. The result indicates the highest-level divine spellcaster the corrupter can cut off from her connection to her deity. The turning damage result indicates the maximum total Hit Dice of divine spellcasters within 60 feet the ability can affect. The corrupter''s intercession affects the closest divine spellcasters it can affect first.

Affected divine spellcasters cannot cast divine spells for 1 minute, except if the corrupter has twice as many corrupter levels as the creature has divine spellcaster levels; in this case, the divine spellcaster loses the ability to cast divine spells for 24 hours.

If the corrupter attacks an affected divine spellcaster in any way, or the affected spellcaster receives an atonement spell, the divine spellcaster is freed from this effect. The corrupter''s allies and other creatures can attack the divine spellcaster without breaking the effect.

The corrupter may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier.

Fiendish Familiar (Su): At 6th level, a corrupter gains the Improved Familiar feat as a bonus feat, even if he normally couldn''t qualify for this feat''s prerequisites. His new familiar must be an imp or a quasit. It benefits from the rules on the Familiars section. The corrupter''s class level counts as the "master class level" for the purposes of determining what benefits the familiar gains.

Fallen Soul (Sp): At 8th level, a corrupter gains the ability to cast fallen soul, as the spell, once per week. He may use this ability an additional time each week every additional four levels, to a maximum of 4 times a week at 20th level.

Code of Conduct
A corrupter must be neutral evil, and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a good act or an act that exposes his faith to an opposing religion and results in his detriment. He must strive to corrupt and taint all faiths apart from his own, with a special focus on good faiths. He is allowed to make whatever vows or declarations are required in order to maintain this deception, as long as he spends at least an hour each day in private prayer to his deity. He must strive to remain hidden, although the methods by which he undermines other faiths are left to his own discretion.

Associates
A corrupter can adventure with characters of any alignment, but remains suspicious and wary of good-aligned characters. He tolerates the presence of good associates only as long as he is secretly working to convert them to evil. He will not continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code by resisting his efforts to convert them. A corrupter may only accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are neutral evil.

Corrupter Spell List
Corrupters choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Bane, cause fear, charm person, cure light wounds, curse water, divine favor, doom, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, profane weapon, protection from good, read magic, resistance, sanctuary, undetectable alignment.

2nd Level: Cat''s grace, calm emotions, desecrate, detect thoughts, eagle''s splendor, enthrall, owl''s wisdom, silence, tongues.

3rd Level: Clairaudience/clairvoyance, cure moderate wounds, dispel magic, glibness, greater magic weapon, inflict moderate wounds, magic circle against good, nondetection, obscure object, scrying.

4th Level: Break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel good, dominate person, dream, greater command, inflict serious wounds, locate creature, unhallow.

Crescent Moon Knight
These unusual paladins of the Order of the Crescent Moon serve either Clangeddin Silverbeard or Selune. The order was founded by an alliance between humans and dwarves to defeat marauding lycanthropes; now, the descendants of the founders teach old family skills and pass heirlooms to the next generation of defenders.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Crescent Moon Knight paladin substitution level, a character must have Clangeddin Silverbeard or Selune as his patron deity, be related to or a close friend of one of the founding families, be a member of the Order of the Crescent Moon, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 4th, 6th, or 10th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Crescent Moon Knight paladin substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin plus Knowledge (local Impiltur).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Crescent Moon Knight substitution levels.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 4th level, a Knight gains lycanthropes as a favored enemy, just as if he were a 1st-level ranger. Unlike standard ranger favored enemies, which are organized by monster type, the Knight''s favored enemy bonuses apply to all lycanthropes regardless of type (for example, the bonuses apply against a human werewolf and a hill giant dire wereboar).

This benefit replaces the turn undead class feature gained by a standard paladin at 4th level.

Cure Lycanthropy (Su): Starting at 6th level, a Knight becomes versed in the methods of curing lycanthropy. A Knight counts as a 12th-level cleric for the purpose of curing lycanthropy within 3 days of a lycanthrope''s attack. A Knight can use his remove disease spell-like ability as if it were break enchantment or remove curse to cure a lycanthrope on the nights of the full moon.

Battlesong (Su): Once per day starting at 10th level, a Knight can begin an inspiring battle song as a standard action. This song functions like a bard''s inspire courage ability, using the Knight''s paladin level minus 4 as his bard level. For example, a 10th-level paladin who selects this substitution level would receive a +1 morale bonus on the relevant rolls, while an 18th-level paladin would receive a +3 morale bonus. A Knight need not have any ranks in Perform to use this class feature.

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell slot gained by a standard paladin at 10th level. From this point forward, a Crescent Moon Knight who selects this substitution level can prepare one less 2nd-level paladin spell than normal.

Curse Breaker
Most paladins use their divinely granted powers to combat diseases that plague their allies. Paladins with an interest in the arcane - particularly those who battle necromancers - sometimes prefer to learn to counteract the effects of magical curses.

Class: Paladin.

Level: 6th.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain the remove disease spell-like ability or any later improvement of that ability.

Benefit: At 6th level, you can produce a remove curse effect, as the spell, once per week. You can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels beyond 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times at 12th, and so forth).

Beginning at 12th level, you can spend two of your weekly uses to produce a break enchantment effect, as the spell.

These are spell-like abilities.

Dead Levels
The paladin has eight dead levels, none of which occur until 7th level. Despite being front loaded with special abilities, paladins gain smite evil and remove disease for the remainder of their levels, along with a special mount and minor spellcasting abilities. Despite these abilities, paladins still gain nothing except for base attack bonuses, hit points, and skill points at 7th and 13th level. Their dead level ability comes with two choices, the first of which has a prerequisite.

Righteous Cause (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a paladin is either rewarded with a bonus to form a lawful community or route out duplicitous intent. The paladin gains an additional bonus at 8th, 11th, 13th, 14th, 16th, 17th, and 19th level. The bonus must be drawn from one of the following two abilities.

Inspiring Presence (Ex): A paladin can become the rallying standard for decency and fairness. If a paladin takes the Leadership feat, the character gains +1 to her leadership score, but only for the purpose of attracting 1st-level followers.

Discerning Insight (Ex): A paladin can recognize when a person is trustworthy or not, giving the character a +1 bonus on Sense Motive checks when trying to get a "hunch" about the subject''s personality after a 1-minute conversation (see Sense Motive).

Despot
The despot can be a local thug who demands protection money from struggling businesses, or she can be the tyrannical ruler of an oppressed nation. In both cases, she profits and thrives from the oppression of those under her net of cruelty and domination. Yet for all her inability to empathize with the hurts and distress of those she stands upon for her own personal empowerment, the despot is not without a rigid form of law and warped honor. She and her minions protect those she rules from other forces. Indeed, in a region besieged with armies of goblinoids, rampaging giants, or ravenous hordes of undead, the local inhabitants might find the rule of a despot preferable.

The despot is always lawful evil, and strives to build an organization of thugs and police to enforce her laws and ideals. Deities of tyranny and oppression often have enforcer followers. Although rare, it is not unheard of for enforcers to serve despots as police, especially in regions where the despot''s rule is less destructive than the threats to her domain. More often, despots are served by lower level despots who strive to serve their master as best they can until they find a chance or method to depose and replace their ruler.

Alignment: Lawful evil.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The despot''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (nobility and royalty) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the despot.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Despots are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Law: The power of a despot''s aura of law (see the detect law spell) is equal to her despot level.

Detect Chaos (Sp): At will, a despot can use detect chaos, as the spell.

Smite Chaos (Su): A despot''s smite targets creatures with a chaotic alignment, but otherwise, it functions the same as the paladin''s ability to smite evil.

Divine Grace (Su): A despot gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Slippery Mind (Ex): The despot has a powerful sense of self and free will, and her mind fights much harder against magical control than most other minds. If a despot is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt the saving throw again 1 round later to break free of the effect, Failing this second saving throw does not grant the despot further saving throws against the enchantment.

Aura of Fear (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a despot exudes an almost palpable aura of menace and evil. Each enemy within 10 feet of her suffers a -4 morale penalty on saving throws against fear effects. The despot herself is deadened to the emotion of fear, and is immune to all fear effects. This ability functions while the despot is conscious, but not if she is unconscious or dead. A despot can suppress or activate this aura as a free action.

Indomitable Will (Su): At 3rd level, the despot''s mind has become an unassailable fortress of ego. She is now completely immune to all spells of the charm subschool.

Oppression (Su): When a despot reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to oppress other living creatures by speaking to them and channeling negative energy into the power of her voice. This is a language-dependant, mind-affecting ability.

When a despot tries to oppress, she makes a turning check (1d20 + her Charisma modifier) as if she were a cleric of three levels lower turning undead. The result of the check indicates how many targets within 60 feet (who must be able to understand the despot''s words) are potentially affected, and the turning damage indicates the total Hit Dice of targets affected. Creatures with chaotic alignments are affected first, and creatures with lawful alignments are affected last. Within the alignment spectrum, closer creatures are affected first.

A target that is oppressed becomes sickened with guilt and depression (-2 penalty on all attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks) for 1 minute.

If the despot has twice as many levels (or more) than any creature that is oppressed, that creature is instead nauseated (can only take a single move action each turn) for 1 minute.

A despot can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier.

Leadership (Ex): Upon reaching 5th level, a despot gains the Leadership feat as a bonus feat. Despots gain a +1 bonus to their Leadership score.

Mark of Justice (Sp): At 7th level, a despot can cast mark of justice, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every four levels after 7th, to a maximum of 4 times a week at 19th level.

Code of Conduct
A despot must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits a chaotic act (such as breaking a vow or contract or betraying an ally). She must at all times work to expand and grow her domain, either by virtue of the Leadership feat or by strong-arming those less fortunate and powerful than herself. She is allowed to abuse her sovereignty in any way she sees fit to further her own personal strength and glory, but she must protect and defend her subjects and allies from harm from other forces. Likewise, she must not overburden her subjects so that they cannot support her.

Associates
A despot adventures only with characters of a non-chaotic alignment and remains suspicious and wary of those who are not lawful. She will never knowingly associate with chaotic characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. This includes remaining in a group in which she is not equal or superior to the highest-level member A despot can adventure or associate with those of equal level, although doing so makes her more uncomfortable and irritable than normal. A despot may only accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful evil.

Despot Spell List
Despots choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Alarm, bane, bless, curse water, command, cure light wounds, detect poison, divine favor, endure elements, magic weapon, profane weapon, protection from chaos, protection from good, resistance, virtue.

2nd Level: Bull''s strength, eagle''s splendor, enthrall, fox''s cunning, hold person, resist energy. status, zone of truth.

3rd Level: Crushing despair, cure moderate wounds, discern lies, helping hand, lesser geas, magic circle against chaos, magic circle against good, prayer, suggestion.

4th Level: Break enchantment, charm monster, cure serious wounds, dispel chaos, dispel good, dominate person, geas/quest, greater command, hold monster.

Detect Undead
Lightbringer paladins are little different from standard paladins, and share the same compassion to pursue good, the will to uphold law, and the power to defeat evil. However, the lightbringer paladin has made it her specialization to seek out and destroy undead, seeing them as the penultimate manifestation of evil in the world.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: Detect evil.

Benefit: A lightbringer paladin can use this ability at will. This is a divination effect similar to a detect evil spell, except that it finds undead only (of any alignment). Unlike with detect evil, the lightbringer paladin doesn''t need to concentrate to know all relevant information. At the moment the paladin uses the ability, she knows if there are any undead within a chosen 60-degree arc, knows the exact number , and knows their exact location. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell. It is a spell-like ability.


Divine Counterspell
Although the ability to turn undead is arguably a defining cleric characteristic, some clerics (and paladins) find that they can be even more effective crusaders by opposing evil spellcasters. The ability to negate an enemy spellcasters magic grants a character an unexpected edge.

Class: Cleric or paladin.

Level: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You gain the supernatural ability to counter another spellcaster''s magic through pure force of will. This ability functions just as if you were using dispel magic to counter the spell, except that you add your cleric level (instead of your caster level) to the d20 roll. You don''t need to identify the spell the opposing spellcaster is casting to make the attempt.

If you don''t have a cleric level, use your effective cleric level for the purpose of turning undead. For example, a paladin would normally turn undead as a cleric of three levels lower; her effective cleric level for counterspelling is equal to her paladin level - 3.

You can attempt to counterspell a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Cha modifier.

A character with 5 or more ranks in Knowledge (arcana) gets a +2 bonus on counterspelling attempts when using this ability.

Divine Spirit
Most paladins form a special relationship with a celestial mount that aids them in battle. You, however, spend most of your time fighting below the ground or in enclosed spaces, where a mount is of little use. Instead, you have forged a bond with celestial spirits whose aid you can call upon when needed.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the special mount ability.

Benefit: Upon reaching 5th level, you can call upon your deity for aid in the form of a celestial spirit. Using this ability is a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. See below for detailed spirit descriptions and rules.

Your paladin level determines which kinds of celestial spirits answer your summons. You can summon the spirit available at your current level as well as any that became available at lower levels.

Paladin
Level	Spirit Summoned
5th-10th	Spirit of healing
11th-15th	Spirit of combat
16th-19th	Spirit of heroism
20th+	Spirit of the fallen
The following entries describe how each of the different spirits function. Unless otherwise specified, all spirits share some characteristics, as set out below.

A spirit occupies a 5-foot square on the battle map.
When summoned, a spirit appears on the battlefield within 30 feet of you. You can use a free action to have it move once per round. The spirit has a land speed of 30 feet.
All spirits are insubstantial and transparent. Any creature can move through them normally, and they do not block line of sight or line of effect.
A spirit cannot attack or be attacked. It is not undead and cannot be turned. It is subject to dispel magic, dismissal, or banishment as if it were a summoned creature, using your paladin level as the caster level.
If you lose line of sight to a spirit, it disappears immediately.
Each spirit available to you can be summoned once per day.
A spirit remains for a number of rounds equal to your paladin level, until it is dismissed, or until special conditions in the spirit''s description are met.
Spirit of Healing: This spirit increases your ability to heal damage dealt to you or your allies. When summoned, it can heal an amount of damage equal to twice the amount you can heal using your lay on hands ability.

To use its healing ability, you or an ally must begin or end your turn in the same square as the spirit. That character can then use a standard action to transfer some or all of the hit points from the spirit to herself. Once the spirit has used all its healing ability, it dissipates.

Spirit of Combat: This spirit enhances combat ability. Whenever an ally (including yourself) is adjacent to the spirit of combat or occupying its space, that character gains holy fervor. Holy fervor grants a +1 sacred bonus on attacks and damage rolls for every four paladin levels you possess (up to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). In addition, affected characters'' weapons are treated as goodaligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Spirit of Heroism: This spirit automatically occupies your space and does not leave until dismissed or dispelled, or the duration of the summoning ends. You gain DR 10/-. In addition, you gain the benefit of the Diehard feat (even if you do not meet the prerequisite) and can use your lay on hands ability as a free action once per round instead of as a standard action.

Spirit of the Fallen: While you or any of your allies are adjacent to this spirit, it grants fast healing 10 to those characters. If an affected character''s hit points drop to 0 or fewer while within 30 feet of this spirit, it revives that character at the start of his next turn, allowing him to take his action as normal. The character heals an amount of damage equal to twice your paladin level, though if his hit points are still at -10 or below, he still dies. The spirit can use its revive ability once per round.

A spirit of the fallen cannot revive creatures whose bodies have been destroyed (such as by a disintegrate spell), nor can it reverse the effects of bodily changes, such as from flesh to stone or baleful polymorph, or other effects that slay a character without dealing damage.

Domain Paladin
Most of the core classes provide many opportunities for variation. With a wide range of abilities, feats, and skills to chose from, the rules provide players with enough choices to round out a unique personality.

Of all the core classes, however, paladins have the least room for uniqueness. They have few skill points, and almost all paladins focus on the same skills: Diplomacy, Heal, Ride, and Sense Motive. Feats follow more or less the same pattern - Mounted Combat and its feat tree are practically must-haves because of the paladin''s special mount class ability. While strict codes for combat and behavior are integral to a paladin''s orderly life, players of paladins sometimes would like a little more variety in the class. The real problem ends up being deities. No matter which deity a paladin worships, her class abilities and spells are always the same. Why should a paladin of Ehlonna be the same as a paladin of Heironeous, or a paladin of Saint Cuthbert the same as one worshipping Yondalla?

The optional rule presented in this article offers paladins a greater variety of powers by making a simple change. In order to select a paladin domain, the paladin gives up her ability to turn undead at 3rd level and selects a domain from the list of paladin domains instead. The domain chosen must belong to the deity worshipped by the paladin. Paladin domains do not provide a list of bonus spells as do cleric domains, but they all feature an associated special ability based on the corresponding cleric domain.

PALADIN DOMAINS
While only Chaos and Evil are banned, paladins rarely select domains other than the ones listed here.

Death: You may use a special death ward effect as a standard action, giving you or a good-aligned creature you touch a bonus on all saves against death effects. This saving throw bonus equals your paladin level -2 and lasts for 1 minute. This granted power may be used a total number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. It is a supernatural ability.

Knowledge: You gain a special divine inspiration power. You may make a special divine inspiration check that functions exactly as a bard''s bardic knowledge class ability, except that it is a supernatural ability. Your divine inspiration bonus is equal to your paladin level + your Charisma modifier, and is usable a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier.

Luck: Once per day, as an extraordinary ability, you may reroll one roll you have just made before the DM declares whether the roll results in success or failure. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it''s worse than the first one.

Magic: You may use scrolls, wands, and other devices with spell completion or spell trigger activation as a wizard of half your paladin level. Any actual wizard levels you have stack with the effective wizard levels gained from this ability. Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft are class skills for you.

Protection: You can generate a protective ward as a supernatural ability. This protective ward grants you or someone you touch a resistance bonus equal to your paladin level -2 on the recipient''s next saving throw. Activating this power is a standard action. The protective ward is an abjuration effect with a duration of 1 hour. It is usable once per day.

Strength: You can perform a feat of strength as a supernatural ability. You gain an enhancement bonus to your Strength score equal to your paladin level -2. Activating this power is a free action. It lasts 1 round, and is usable once per day.

War: You may invoke a special true warrior power as a supernatural ability, allowing you to bypass the damage reduction of any evil-aligned creature. Invoking the true warrior ability is a free action, but it must be activated before rolling your attack. Its effects last for 1 round, and you can invoke it once per day.

Dragonborn Paladin
Lawful good dragonborn often become paladins. The class is in harmony with their dedicated nature to sanctify themselves through honorable service in the Dragonfall War. Many of the paladin''s abilities make a dragonborn character extraordinarily well suited for fighting the spawn of Tiamat.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
A dragonborn paladin normally takes substitution levels at 1st level and when she would take her 4th and 5th paladin levels. However, a paladin who becomes a dragonborn later in her career can choose to retroactively take any or all dragonborn paladin substitution levels as replacements for class levels she has already gained.

Class Skills
Dragonborn paladin substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class, plus Knowledge (arcana).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Dragonborn Paladin Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Aura of good, detect dragonblood, smite evil 1/day	—
4th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Bahamut''s blessing	Same as paladin
5th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Fearless special mount, smite evil 2/day	Same as paladin
Class Features
All the following are class features of the dragonborn paladin racial substitution levels.

Detect Dragonblood (Sp): A 1st-level dragonborn paladin can use detect dragonblood at will. This is a divination effect similar to a detect evil spell, except that it detects dragonblood creatures of any alignment. A dragonborn paladin can scan a 60-degree arc each round. By concentrating for 1 round, she knows if any dragonblood creatures are within the arc; concentrating for 2 rounds reveals the exact number of such creatures; and concentrating for 3 rounds reveals their exact locations. This ability is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s detect evil class feature.

Bahamut''s Blessing (Su): At 4th level, a dragonborn paladin who uses her smite evil ability against evil dragons and dragonbloods gains an additional +2 bonus on the attack roll. She also deals 1 extra point of damage per two paladin levels. For example, a 13th-level dragonborn paladin with a 20 Strength and armed with a +2 longsword deals 1d8+26 points of damage when using smite evil against an evil dragonblood (+13 from normal smite evil, +6 from Bahamut''s blessing, + 5 from Str, and +2 from the longsword).

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s turn undead ability.

Fearless Special Mount (Sp): A 5th-level dragonborn paladin''s special mount is immune to the frightful presence of dragons, in addition to having the standard qualities of a special mount.

This substitution feature replaces the improvement in base attack bonus normally gained by a 5th-level paladin. From 5th level on, a dragonborn paladin''s base attack bonus is 1 lower than that of a standard paladin of her level.

Dragonscale Husk
Any warrior knows that skill in battle isn''t enough; you must also guard against the attacks of your enemies. A well-forged suit of armor can mean the difference between life and death, but a warrior whose very body is his armor has an immediate advantage. Those who have the blood of dragons running in their veins can gain this benefit.

Class: Any standard class that grants proficiency in heavy armor, such as fighter or paladin.

Level: 1st (unless the class grants proficiency in heavy armor at a level other than 1st, in which case this feature can be taken only at that level).

Special Requirement: You must be of the dragonblood subtype to select this alternative class feature. As long as you gain the dragonblood subtype at the same level that you would gain heavy armor proficiency, you can select this class feature, even if you would normally choose class features before selecting the option that grants you the subtype. For example, a 1st-level human fighter who takes Dragontouched as one of his 1st-level feats could also select this class feature.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain proficiency with any kind of armor. If you would later gain some form of armor proficiency (such as by multiclassing or taking a feat), you can choose at that time to gain that profi ciency, but you then lose this class feature. If you already have proficiency with any kind of armor, you must lose that proficiency in order to select this class feature.

Benefit: You gain the extraordinary ability to grow a thick, scaly hide that protects you like armor. The dragonscale husk resembles the scales of a dragon of your choice (selected when you gain the class feature). The husk requires 8 hours to grow, but this process can take place at night while you are sleeping.

Your scaled hide grants you a bonus to your Armor Class equal to 6 + 1/3 your class level in the class that granted you heavy armor proficiency (+7 bonus to AC at 3rd level, +8 bonus to AC at 6th level, and so on, up to a maximum +12 bonus to AC at 18th level). Multiple classes that grant this proficiency stack for determining the dragonscale husk''s total bonus. This bonus doesn''t stack with any feat, racial trait, or other special ability that would grant you a bonus to Armor Class.

In addition, as you attain higher levels, your husk grants you increasing resistance to acid, cold, electricity, and fire. You gain resistance 5 at 5th level, resistance 10 at 10th level, resistance 15 at 15th level, and resistance 20 at 20th level.

Your dragonscale husk is treated as medium armor for the purpose of determining your speed and whether you can use class features or other special abilities. It allows a maximum Dexterity bonus to Armor Class of +2 and has an armor check penalty of -4. You can sleep in your husk without penalty. You cannot wear any other armor while your husk is present.

Your husk isn''t treated as armor for the purpose of being affected by spells or other abilities. You can''t grant it an enhancement bonus with magic vestment, nor can you imbue it with special properties, as you could a normal suit of armor.

You can''t take off your dragonscale husk, but you can choose to shed it. Doing this requires 10 minutes of concentration and results in your sloughing off a pile of scales that crumble to dust if handled.

Drakkensteed Mount
Paladins who revere dragons or draconic deities, though few in number, sometimes summon dragon-descended beasts known as drakkensteeds to serve as their special mounts. Unlike a standard warhorse, unicorn, or other special mount used by paladins, drakkensteeds are more than just outstanding members of mundane races - they are nearly legendary beasts seen by few and mastered by even fewer.

Class: Paladin.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard paladin''s special mount.

Benefit: You gain the service of a loyal drakkensteed. It functions in all ways as any other special mount gained by a paladin (including advancing its statistics, gaining special abilities, and so forth), except that it can''t command animals.

Elf Paladin
Though elves typically tend toward chaos and freedom over law and order, an elf paladin can become a beacon of righteousness. He gives up some of his single-minded dedication in exchange for abilities that work well with his racial aptitudes.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take an elf paladin substitution level, a character must be an elf about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Elf paladin substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard paladin class, plus Survival.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Elf Paladin Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Aura of good, detect evil, ranged smite evil 1/day	—
3rd	+3	+3	+1	+1	Aura of freedom, divine health	—
5th	+5	+4	+1	+1	Ranged smite evil 2/day, unicorn mount	Same as paladin
Class Features
All the following are features of the elf paladin''s racial substitution levels.

Ranged Smite Evil (Su): An elf paladin can only deliver his smite evil attacks with a longbow (or composite longbow) or shortbow (or composite shortbow). The target must be within 30 feet for the paladin to use this ability. This ability otherwise functions identically to the normal smite evil class feature.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s class feature of smite evil. At each level at which the paladin would normally gain an additional daily use of smite evil, the elf paladin instead gains a daily use of ranged smite evil.

Aura of Freedom (Su): A 3rd-level elf paladin radiates an aura that helps his allies resist effects that would influence their minds. Each ally within 10 feet of him gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against enchantment effects. This ability functions while the paladin is conscious, but not if he is unconscious or dead.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s ability of aura of courage.

Unicorn Mount (Sp): A 5th-level elf paladin gains the service of a unicorn to serve him in his crusade against evil. This ability is identical to the paladin''s special mount class feature, except that the paladin is treated as six levels lower than normal for the purpose of determining the mount''s bonus HD, natural armor adjustment, and Strength adjustment (but not other special abilities). The unicorn serves as a loyal steed regardless of the paladin''s gender.

For example, an elf paladin''s unicorn mount doesn''t gain the adjusted statistics of a 5th-level paladin''s mount (+2 HD, +4 natural armor adjustment, and +1 Strength adjustment - see The Paladin''s Mount) until the paladin is 11th level. It gains the other special abilities of a paladin''s mount at the normal levels (empathic link, improved evasion, share spells, and share saving throws at 5th level, improved speed at 8th level, command at 11th level, and spell resistance at 15th level). The unicorn mount may only use its command ability on horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s class feature of special mount.

Enforcer
The enforcer is the ultimate warrior for law and works hand in hand with his patron deity and his liege. To an enforcer, the laws of the land are as holy as the laws of his religion. Upholding and enforcing the laws take complete precedence over all other factors, and those who would flaunt or ignore the law deserve swift, but appropriate, punishment.

An enforcer is always lawful neutral. Deities of protection and nobility often have enforcer followers, especially in large cities where such deities are worshiped heavily. Enforcers form large knighthoods that are usually based within a structure built on the grounds of the local ruler''s estate and often work with paladins to fight against crime and civil unrest.

Alignment: Lawful neutral.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The enforcer''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (history) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), and Sense Motive (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the enforcer.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Enforcers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Law: The power of an enforcer''s aura of law (see the detect law spell) is equal to his enforcer level.

Detect Chaos (Sp): At will, an enforcer can use detect chaos, as the spell.

Smite Chaos (Su): An enforcer''s smite targets creatures with a chaotic alignment, but otherwise, it functions the same as the paladin''s ability to smite evil.

Divine Grace (Su): An enforcer gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Subdue (Ex): A 2nd-level enforcer has learned how to efficiently inflict non-lethal damage with weapons. He does not suffer the standard -4 penalty to attack rolls when he attacks to inflict non-lethal damage with a weapon that normally deals lethal damage, as long as he is proficient with the weapon being used. In addition, when an enforcer attacks to inflict non-lethal damage with a weapon specifically designed to do non-lethal damage (such as a sap or whip), he gains a +2 bonus to weapon damage rolls.

Aura of Courage (Su): An enforcer gains this ability at 3rd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Suggestion (Sp): At 3rd level, an enforcer may cast suggestion, as the spell. He may use this ability once per day at 3rd level. At 8th level, and every five levels thereafter, he may use this ability one additional time per day, to a maximum of four times a day at 18th level. Caster level is equal to the enforcer''s class level.

Rebuke Undead (Su): When an enforcer reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to rebuke or command undead as an evil cleric three levels lower would. The enforcer can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. Enforcers are expected to use commanded undead to further the cause of law and generally don''t keep commanded undead under their control for more than 24 hours, especially if the presence of undead causes chaos in society.

Leadership (Ex): Upon reaching 5th level, an enforcer gains the Leadership feat as a bonus feat. Enforcers gain a +1 bonus to their leadership score, although the maximum number and level of their followers and cohorts remains standard.

Dominate Person (Sp): At 7th level, an enforcer can cast dominate person, as the spell, once per week. He can use this ability one additional time per week for every four levels after 7th. Caster level is equal to the enforcer''s class level.

Code of Conduct
An enforcer must be of lawful neutral alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a chaotic act (such as breaking a vow or contract or betraying an ally). Unlike the other holy warriors, enforcers are bound to the will of two beings. Their primary liege remains their divine patron, but they must also serve the will of their worldly liege. The enforcer''s patron deity and his liege''s patron deity must be the same. If an enforcer believes his liege is not acting in the best interests of his deity, he is permitted to act against his liege as long as he can expose his liege''s heresy within 24 hours. An enforcer is not allowed to accept a position of leadership that would place him in a position where he would not have a liege above him in the rank of command, except in the case of an emergency (and even then, for no more than 24 hours). The enforcer must uphold and enforce the laws of the church and land at all times, even when the laws would prevent him from fully accomplishing a desired personal goal.

Associates
An enforcer can adventure with characters of any non-chaotic alignment but remains suspicious and wary of those who are not lawful. He will never knowingly associate with chaotic characters, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. An enforcer may only accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are lawful neutral.

Enforcer Spell List
Enforcers choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Alarm, bless, bless water, bless weapon, command, cure light wounds, detect poison, divine favor, endure elements, hold portal, magic weapon, protection from chaos, resistance, sleep, virtue.

2nd Level: Bull''s strength eagle''s splendor, fox''s cunning, hold person, resist energy, shield other, status, zone of truth.

3rd Level: Cure moderate wounds, discern lies, magic circle against chaos, prayer, remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, remove disease.

4th Level: Break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel chaos, greater command, hold monster, mark of justice, neutralize poison, restoration.


Eternal Order
The primary duty of the Knights of the Eternal Order - Kelemvor''s main order of paladins - is to hunt and destroy powerful undead. They develop powerful undead-fighting powers by sacrificing other paladin abilities.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take an Eternal Order substitution level, a character must have Kelemvor as her patron deity, be a member of the Knights of the Eternal Order, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Eternal Order substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Eternal Order substitution levels.

Corpsestrike (Su): An Eternal Order paladin can, as a swift action, surround her weapon with a visible gray aura of holy power that sheds light equal to a candle. Any weapon so affected can ignore any damage reduction (other than DR #/epic) possessed by an undead creature, regardless of its source. This aura lasts for a number of minutes equal to the paladin''s class level.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s smite evil class feature. Any time an Eternal Order paladin would later gain an extra smite evil attempt (such as at 5th level), she can instead use this ability one extra time per day.

Undead Knowledge (Ex): Each time an Eternal Order substitution level is taken, the character gains a cumulative +2 competence bonus on Knowledge (religion) checks concerning undead.

Eternal Vigor (Ex): Beginning at 3rd level, an Eternal Order paladin can ignore the effects of negative levels bestowed upon her by an undead creature.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s divine health class feature.

Greater Turning (Su): At 6th level, an Eternal Order paladin gains the ability to perform a greater turning once per day in place of a regular turning, just as if she had access to the Sun domain.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s remove disease class feature normally gained at 6th level. At any level where a standard paladin gains an extra daily use of remove disease, an Eternal Order paladin instead gains another daily use of her greater turning ability.

Gaze of Truth
For you, justice is paramount.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the ability to detect evil.

Benefit: You can discern when someone is lying to you, as the spell discern lies. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Charisma modifier (minimum 1/day). The target is afforded a Will save (DC 10 + half your paladin level + your Charisma modifier). If he succeeds, you cannot discern lies from him for 24 hours. Each use of this ability lasts for 1 round per paladin level.

Additionally, you add detect evil to the paladin spell list.

Note: You should discuss this ability with your DM before choosing it. While it is appropriate for some campaigns, such ready use of a truth-finding ability can quickly spoil a game in which lies, subterfuge, and intrigue play a significant part.

Gnome Paladin
Gnome paladins chuckle at the stereotype of paladins as self-righteous, honor-bound, humorless sticks-in-the-mud, especially when someone thinks it applies to them. You might make the following changes to a gnome paladins class features to emphasize her racial characteristics:

Class Skills: Replace Knowledge (nobility and royalty) with Perform (comedy).

Special Mount (Sp): A 5th-level gnome paladin may summon a dire badger as a special mount. It gains special abilities at the same rate as a standard special mount. Due to their connection with burrowing creatures, many gnome paladins call for a dire badger special mount when possible. Other gnome paladin mounts might include the black bear, boar, dire eagle, dire toad, dire weasel, and wolverine.

Golarion Paladin
Paladins trained in the Holy Citadel of Light focus specifically on the destruction of undead and are often charged with cleansing the land around Gallowspire of its necrotic taint. These paladins gain the above special ability, which replaces the remove disease ability gained at 6th level and all increases in that ability.

Light of Purity (Su): Starting at 6th level, a paladin with this ability can emit a radiance of blinding light once per week. This light acts like a daylight spell, save that it only lasts for 1 round per level of the paladin. In addition, any undead within 30 feet of the paladin emitting this light takes 1d6 points of damage per round for every two levels the paladin has attained. A Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the paladin''s level + the paladin''s Cha modifier) halves this damage. A paladin may use the light of purity one additional time per week for every three additional levels he has attained, to a maximum of five times at 18th level.

Golden Cup
Paladins who are members of the Order of the Golden Cup serve Ilmater and have dedicated themselves to healing the sick and weak and protecting the innocent. Peaceful counterparts to the Companions of the Noble Heart, they don''t shy away from combating evil, but they allow their companions to actively hunt it down while they focus on protecting those who can''t protect themselves.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Golden Cup substitution level, a character must have Ilmater as her patron deity, be a member of the Order of the Golden Cup, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 4th, or 10th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Golden Cup substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

10th	+10/+5	+7	+3	+3	Expanded healing	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Golden Cup substitution levels.

Defend the Weak (Ex): Starting at 3rd level, a Golden Cup paladin can protect nearby allies in combat. If she uses Combat Expertise, fights defensively, or uses the total defense action, she can grant the dodge bonus to AC from these actions to any single creature standing adjacent to her in addition to herself.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s aura of courage class feature.

Shield Other (Sp): Beginning at 4th level, a Golden Cup paladin can use shield other as a spell-like ability. She needs no focus for this ability, but she must be able to touch the character. She can use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma bonus (minimum 1/day), though she can''t affect more than one target simultaneously (a second use ends the duration of any previous use). Her caster level is equal to her paladin level.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s turn undead class feature.

Expanded Healing (Su): Beginning at 10th level, a Golden Cup paladin can treat her paladin level as three higher than normal for the purpose of determining the maximum amount of healing she can bestow with her lay on hands ability per day. She can also treat her caster level as three higher than normal for the purpose of any conjuration (healing) spell she casts.

This benefit replaces the third daily use of the smite evil ability gained by a standard paladin at 10th level. From this point forward, she has one less daily use of smite evil than normal.

Golden Lion
The Order of the Golden Lion serves Torm and was created specifically to serve the Penance of Duty accepted by those of his faith. Members of the order are a varied bunch but united in their devotion and strength of purpose. They develop special powers to defend good temples, defeat Faerunian evils, and repair damage to the Weave.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Golden Lion paladin substitution level, a character must have Torm as her patron deity, maintain the appearance of her armor and helm in accordance with the standards of the order, be a member of the Order of the Golden Lion, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 1st, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

Furthermore, as part of an ongoing atonement for their church''s hostilities toward other good churches in the years preceding the Time of Troubles, the Golden Lions pledge to help rebuild and defend these churches. Once per month each Golden Lion must perform a quest for or spend a day defending a good temple of another faith. The Golden Lion must follow orders from this temple as if they came from her own temple, but can disregard any order that conflicts with her own faith or that would certainly result in her death (the good faiths involved understand the boundaries of the Penance of Duty and won''t ask for things they wouldn''t ask of their own champions of the faith).

Class Skills
Golden Lion substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Restore the Weave 1/day	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Golden Lion substitution levels.

Detect Magic (Sp): A Golden Lion can use a detect magic effect at will. Her caster level is equal to her paladin level.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s detect evil ability.

Enemy of Strife (Su): Golden Lions are tasked with eliminating the Zhentarim and the churches of Bane and Cyric. Beginning at 4th level, any smite evil attack used against a member of one of these groups (or a creature created or conjured by a member of one of these groups) automatically ignores any miss chance from concealment and overcomes damage reduction as if it were made with a good-aligned weapon.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s ability to turn undead.

Restore the Weave (Sp): At 6th level, once per day a Golden Lion can repair a 5-foot cube of dead magic or wild magic area, returning it to its normal function. This ability only works if the paladin stands in an area of normal Weave that is adjacent to the damaged area (in other words, it cannot create an "island" of normal Weave within a damaged area). Slowly but surely, the Golden Lions can repair large problem areas. This spell-like ability is the equivalent of a 3rd-level spell.

This benefit replaces the remove disease class feature gained by a standard paladin at 6th level. At any level where a standard paladin gains an extra daily use of remove disease, a Golden Lion can instead gain another daily use of her restore the Weave ability.

Half-Orc Paladin
At first glance, the concept of a half-orc paladin seems a contradiction in terms. But those rare half-orcs with the necessary dedication to law and goodness become the most zealous protectors of righteousness.

Hit Die: d12.

Requirements
To take a half-orc paladin substitution level, a character must be a half-orc about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Half-orc paladin substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class, except that Diplomacy is dropped and Intimidate is added.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Remove fatigue 1/week	Same as paladin
Class Features
All the following are features of the half-orc paladin racial substitution levels.

Righteous Fury (Ex): A half-orc paladin can fly into a fury of righteous fervor once per day, dealing powerful blows to his enemies. Entering a righteous fury is a free action. While in a righteous fury, the half-orc paladin gains a +2 morale bonus on melee weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every four class levels, to +3 at 4th level, +4 at 8th level, up to a maximum of +7 at 20th level. The half-orc remains in this fury for 1 round plus 1 round per point of Charisma bonus (minimum 1 round).

At 5th level, and at every five class levels thereafter, the half-orc paladin may enter this righteous fury one additional time per day.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s smite evil ability. A half-orc paladin who selects this substitution feature never gains any daily uses of smite evil.

Aura of Awe (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a half-orc paladin is immune to fear (magical or otherwise). In addition, evil creatures within 10 feet of the character take a -2 penalty on saves against fear effects (or on checks made to resist his Intimidate attempts).

This substitution feature replaces the base paladin''s aura of courage ability.

Remove Fatigue (Sp): At 6th level, a half-orc paladin can remove the fatigued condition from all allies within a 30-foot burst centered on him. (This has no effect on exhausted allies.) He can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times per week at 12th, and so forth).

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s remove disease ability. A half-orc paladin who selects this substitution feature never gains any weekly uses of remove disease.

Harmonious Knight
Paladins of the Harmonious Order, called Harmonious Knights, serve Milil and do good works in his name, though they tend to be egotistical and overly sure of themselves. Milil grants paladins of this order musical abilities to complement their fighting.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Harmonious Knight substitution level, a character must have Milil as his patron deity, be a member of the Harmonious Order, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 1st, 6th, or 9th level of paladin.

Class Skills
A Harmonious Knight adds Perform to the standard paladin''s list of class skills.

9th	+9/+4	+6	+3	+3	Inspire greatness 1/day	Same as paladin
Class Features
All the following are features of the Harmonious Knight substitution levels.

Inspire Courage (Su): A Harmonious Knight can use songs to inspire courage in his allies and himself. As a standard action, he can sing rallying or inspiring war songs that grant all allies that hear him a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls. This effect lasts as long as the Harmonious Knight sings, and for 5 rounds afterward. This ability is usable once per day per paladin level, and Harmonious Knight substitution levels count as paladin levels for this purpose.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s detect evil ability.

Inspire Competence (Su): A 6th-level Harmonious Knight with at least 4 ranks in Perform can use singing to help an ally (but not himself) succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the Harmonious Knight. The ally gains a +2 competence bonus on skill checksmade with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the Harmonious Knight''s singing (maximum 2 minutes). Inspire competence is a mind-affecting ability and is usable once per day.

This benefit replaces the remove disease ability that the standard paladin gains at 6th level. From this point onward, the character has one fewer weekly uses of remove disease than a normal paladin of his level does.

Inspire Greatness (Su): A 9th-level Harmonious Knight with at least 5 ranks in Perform can sing to inspire greatness in himself or one chosen ally as a standard action. The effect lasts for as long as the ally hears the Harmonious Knight sing and for 5 rounds thereafter. The affected ally gains 2 bonus Hit Dice (d10s), the commensurate number of temporary hit points (applying the target''s Constitution modifier, if any, to both extra Hit Dice), a +2 competence bonus on attack rolls, and a +1 competence bonus on Fortitude saves. The bonus Hit Dice count as regular Hit Dice for determining the effect of spells such as sleep. Inspire greatness is a mind-affecting ability and is usable once per day.

This benefit replaces the second weekly use of remove disease that the standard paladin gains at 9th level. From this point onward, the Harmonious Knight gains another daily use of inspire greatness or inspire competence (if he took the 6th Harmonious Knight level) instead of each additional weekly use of remove disease that he would otherwise have gained.

Holy Judge
This group of Tyr-worshiping paladins is focused primarily on its god''s lawful aspects. The Holy Judges hunt and punish criminals and lawbreakers, and they have a fervent hatred for devils, which they see as a terrible perversion of a lawful society.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Holy Judge substitution level, a character must have Tyr as her patron deity, be a member of the Knights of Holy Judgment, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 1st, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Holy Judge substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class plus Knowledge (the planes).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Holy Judge substitution levels.

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a Holy Judge gains devils as a favored enemy, just as if he were a 1st-level ranger. Unlike standard ranger favored enemies, which are classified by monster type, a Holy Judge''s favored enemy bonuses apply only to devils, not all kinds of evil outsiders.

At 5th level, and every five levels thereafter, the bonus granted by the Holy Judge''s favored enemy class feature improves by 2. This increase has no effect on any other favored enemies the Holy Judge might have.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s smite evil class feature.

Censure Devil (Su): A Holy Judge on his home plane can utter words of censuring that can daze a devil within 30 feet. The devil must succeed on a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin level + Cha modifier) or be dazed for 1 round. A Holy Judge can use this ability a number of times per day equal to three + his Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s ability to turn undead.

Zone of Truth (Sp): A Holy Judge can use a zone of truth effect once per week, using his paladin level as his caster level.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin remove disease class feature. If the Holy Judge would later gain an extra weekly use of remove disease, he instead gains an extra weekly use of zone of truth.

Holy Warrior
By giving up your spellcasting ability, you gain access to bonus feats much as a fighter does. This choice does not, however, close you off from divine influence - in fact, several of these feats actually increase your divine power.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: To select this class feature, you must sacrifice your spellcasting ability.

Benefit: You no longer gain spells as a paladin, but you can now select a bonus feat at 4th, 8th, 11th, and 14th levels. You can select any feat from the following list for which you meet the prerequisites: any divine feat, Cleave, Extra Smiting, Extra Turning, Great Cleave, Improved Smiting, Mounted Combat, Mounted Archery, Power Attack, Ride-By Attack, Skill Focus (Ride), Spirited Charge, and Trample. This is an extraordinary ability.

Special: A paladin who selects this path can no longer use scrolls, wands, or other magic items that require access to a spell list, unless she has another spellcasting class that grants access to the appropriate spells.

Hunter of Fiends
You actively seek out demons and devils to slay rather than waiting for them to come to you.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you choose this ability you lose the ability to smite evil and give up Knowledge (royalty and nobility) as a class skill.

Benefit: You gain outsider (evil) as a favored enemy, as the ranger ability, except the bonus you gain equals half your paladin level (minimum +1). You gain no additional favored enemies at later levels. In addition, you gain Track as a bonus feat and Survival and Knowledge (the planes) as class skills.

Incarnate
The incarnate is unique among the divine champions in that she does not serve a patron deity. Rather, she focuses her faith and belief in the philosophy of Balance, that the best of all possible worlds is both good and evil, both lawful and chaotic, all in equal balance. She receives her divine spells and abilities through her unwavering devotion to Balance. When one force becomes too powerful in a region, she fights to restore the balance, either by allying with the opposing force or fighting on her own. An overly lawful society that oppresses its populace is just as wrong in the incarnate''s eyes as a society that collapses into anarchy and barbarism. Likewise, a creature that indiscriminately treats everything with kindness and understanding is just as offensive as one that kills and slaughters without remorse.

Incarnates are always neutral. They rarely have patron deities. Incarnates form into loosely knit groups to better protect the Balance. The meetings of these groups take place in large secular buildings or natural regions and often involve long debates about whether imbalance exists and how to best correct it. The non-aligned aspect of the natural world appeals to many incarnates, and most of them prefer to live in the wild. They enjoy the company of druids and often work with them to accomplish a common goal, but most such alliances eventually fall apart due to the incarnates'' belief that civilization and the natural world must also find balance.

Alignment: Neutral.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The incarnate''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the incarnate.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Incarnates are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Detect Imbalance (Sp): Incarnates are sensitive to the presence of creatures with alignment subtypes because of how unbalancing the presence of such creatures can be. This ability functions as the detect undead spell, save that it detects creatures with an alignment subtype rather than the type. This ability does not determine the alignment or subtype of the creature, just the presence.

Elemental Affinity (Ex): The elemental planes are closer to the mind of an incarnate than the Outer Planes. As a result, an incarnate has a particular affinity to two elements, either air and earth or fire and water. She must select one of these pairings upon taking her first incarnate level. Each element is associated with a form of energy, as detailed below.

Element	Associated
Energy Type
Air	Electricity
Earth	Acid
Fire	Fire
Water	Cold
Smite Extremist (Su): An incarnate''s smite targets creatures of the following alignments: lawful good, lawful evil, chaotic good, and chaotic evil. When the incarnate makes a smite attack, she must decide which alignment she is smiting, but otherwise, it functions the same as the paladin''s ability to smite evil.

Divine Grace (Su): An incarnate gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Elemental Burst (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, an incarnate with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can create a burst of energy appropriate to her elemental affinity. Use of this supernatural ability is a standard action. She can direct this burst of energy at any target within 60 feet as a ranged touch attack. A successful hit deals 1d4 points of damage plus the incarnate''s Charisma modifier of both the incarnate''s associated energy types. Thus an incarnate who has a Charisma of 13 and is associated with both fire and water would deal 1d4+1 points of fire damage and 1d4+1 points of cold damage to a target struck by the attack. The incarnate can generate a number of elemental bursts in a day equal to her Charisma bonus.

Aura of Courage (Su): An incarnate gains this ability at 3rd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Energy Resistance (Ex): At 3rd level, the incarnate gains energy resistance 5 to the types of energy associated with her elemental affinity.

Rebuke Outsider (Su): When an incarnate reaches 4th level, she gains the supernatural ability to rebuke or command outsiders. She can only use this ability while she is on the Material Plane. The incarnate can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + her Charisma modifier. The incarnate turns outsiders as a cleric three levels lower would turn undead.

Elemental Minion (Sp): Upon reaching 5th level, an incarnate gains the ability to summon a Medium elemental (air, earth, fire, or water) as a standard action usable once a day. This elemental must be one of the types she is associated with due to her elemental affinity. This elemental minion carries the same responsibilities as a paladin''s special mount and gains the same bonuses to its HD, natural armor, Strength, Intelligence, and other special abilities that a paladin''s special mount gains when the incarnate gains levels. Unlike the paladin''s special mount, the elemental minion only remains for 1 hour/level before returning to the elemental plane from whence it came.

Commune with Nature (Sp): At 8th level, an incarnate gains the ability to commune with nature, as the spell, once per week. She may use this ability an additional time each week every additional four levels, to a maximum of 4 times a week at 20th level.

Code of Conduct
An incarnate must be of neutral alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits an act that endangers the natural balance of the world. The incarnate is most at home in the wilderness, but she does not take any special vows to avoid city life. She avoids travel to other planes (with the exception of the Elemental Planes to which she has an affinity) except in the most dire need. The incarnate prefers to arrive at peaceful solutions but is fully capable of using force against unwanted intrusions into this realm from beyond.

Associates
An incarnate can adventure with characters of any alignment but remains suspicious and wary of those who draw their powers from the Outer Planes (including most clerics and other holy warriors). She tolerates the presence of native outsiders such as aasimar and tieflings, but would prefer not to share their company if possible. She never knowingly associates with creatures of an alignment subtype, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. An incarnate may only accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are neutral.

Incarnate Spell List
Incarnates choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Bless, bless water, bless weapon, charm animal, cure light wounds, detect poison, divine favor, endure elements, entangle, longstrider, magic fang, magic weapon, pass without trace, protection from chaos, protection from evil, protection from good, protection from law, speak with animals.

2nd Level: Animal messenger, barkskin, bear''s endurance, bull''s strength, eagle''s splendor, hold person, lesser restoration, owl''s wisdom, resist energy, shield other, spike growth, tree shape.

3rd Level: Cure moderate wounds, diminish plants, dominate animal, greater magic fang, magic circle against chaos, magic circle against evil, magic circle against good, magic circle against law, plant growth, prayer, speak with plants.

4th Level: Break enchantment, command plants, cure serious wounds, dismissal, dispel chaos, dispel evil, dispel good, dispel law, freedom of movement, tree stride.

Inquisitor
The paladin who takes an active role in hunting her foul enemies must give up her defensive powers.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Lay on hands, turn undead, remove disease.

Gain: Favored enemy (as ranger; may only select aberrations, dragons, giants, monstrous humanoids, evil outsiders, or undead).

Lion Legionnaire
The mighty wemic paladins of Nobanion are called the Legion of Lions; they are small in number but great in their bravery. Unlike most of Lord Firemane''s wemic followers, they travel outside the Shaar in search of evil, and partly because of their efforts Nobanion''s faith has attracted humanoid followers. Though most Lion Legionnaires are wemics, a small number are humanoids, and at least one lammasu is a member of this elite group. Rather than traditional paladin abilities, they develop powers relating to Nobanion''s strengths and tactics.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Lion Legionnaire substitution level, a character must have Nobanion as his patron deity, be a member of the Legion of Lions, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 3rd, 4th, or 5th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Lion Legionnaire substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class plus Knowledge (nature).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.


Table: Lion Legionnaire Substitution Levels

3rd	+3	+3	+1	+1	Divine health, firemane aura	—
4th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Wild fighting	Same as paladin
5th	+5	+4	+1	+1	Smite evil 2/day, flying lion	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Lion Legionnaire substitution levels.

Firemane Aura (Su): Once per day a Lion Legionnaire can create an aura of holy flame around his body. As this ability activates, the paladin''s hair or mane (if any) momentarily turns into a brilliant golden flame. Any evil creature striking a Lion Legionnaire with a natural weapon, or a melee weapon that is not a reach weapon, takes damage equal to the Legionnaire''s paladin level. Half of this damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not subject to being reduced by resistance to fire. This aura lasts for 1 minute.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s aura of courage class feature.

Wild Fighting (Su): Lion Legionnaires develop a fighting style that gives them extra attacks at the cost of accuracy. As a free action, a Lion Legionnaire can enter a state of wild fighting for 1 round. During this round, a Legionnaire can make one extra attack with any one melee weapon (including natural weapons), but all attacks made during the round (including the extra attack) take a -2 penalty. A Lion Legionnaire must use a full attack action to benefit from wild fighting. A Lion Legionnaire can use this ability a number of times per day equal to three + his Charisma modifier.

This benefit replaces the turn undead class feature gained by a standard paladin at 4th level.

Flying Lion (Su): At 5th level, a Lion Legionnaire gains the ability to grow eagle''s wings, as Nobanion himself sometimes does in battle. Once per day as a full-round action, the Legionnaire grows feathered wings appropriate to the size of his body. The wings remain for up to 10 minutes per paladin level, though he can dismiss them as a free action. He can fly with the wings at his normal land speed, with poor maneuverability. Nonleonine creatures who use this ability temporarily gain a lionlike appearance while it is used (catlike eyes, a thick mane of hair, and larger teeth).

This benefit replaces the special mount class feature gained by a standard paladin at 5th level (Nobanion''s wemic paladins have no need for a quadruped mount to carry them into battle).

Mystic Fire Knight
The Knights of the Mystic Fire serve Mystra by guarding her temples and questing for lost magical troves. They develop increased ability to use magic, counter hostile magic, and defeat enemy spellcasters.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Mystic Fire Knight substitution level, a character must have Mystra as her patron deity, be a member of the Knights of the Mystic Fire, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 4th, 5th, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Mystic Fire Knight substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin plus Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

14th	+14/+9/+4	+9	+4	+4	Bonus spells	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Mystic Fire Knight substitution levels.

Bonus Spells (Su): At 4th level, a Mystic Fire Knight gains a bonus 1st-level paladin spell slot as if from a high Wisdom score. At 8th level, she gains a bonus 2nd-level paladin spell slot, at 11th level she gains a bonus 3rd-level paladin spell slot, and at 14th level she gains a bonus 4th-level paladin spell slot.

This benefit replaces the turn undead class feature gained by a standard paladin at 4th level.

Improved Spellcasting (Ex): When casting paladin spells, a Mystic Fire Knight can treat her caster level as equal to one-half her paladin level +2. If she also has arcane spellcasting ability from another class, she can add her caster level from that class to this value to determine her paladin caster level.

Smite Evil (Su): In addition to the normal effect, when a Mystic Fire Knight of 5th level or higher hits a creature with her smite evil attack, that creature finds it temporarily difficult to cast spells or use spell completion or spell trigger items. For 1 round, any attempt to complete one of these actions requires a successful Concentration check (DC 10 + paladin''s level + Cha modifier + spell level); failure means that the action fails. If a spell was being cast, the spell or spell slot is lost; if a magic item was being activated, the attempt merely fails. Multiple smite evil hits on the same creature don''t have a cumulative effect.

This class feature augments, but does not replace, the standard paladin''s smite evil class feature.

Spellshatter (Su): Once per day starting at 6th level, a Mystic Fire Knight can choose to deliver a targeted greater dispel magic effect with a melee attack. The decision to use this ability must be made before the attack is rolled; if the attack misses, the effect is wasted.

If the attack hits, treat this as if the Mystic Fire Knight had cast a targeted greater dispel magic on the creature struck, using her paladin level (plus any arcane caster level she might have from another class) as her caster level, up to a maximum of +20.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s remove disease class feature. If the Mystic Fire Knight would later gain an extra weekly use of remove disease, she instead gains an extra daily use of spellshatter.

Noble Heart
The Companions of the Noble Heart are aggressive knights in the service of Ilmater who have dedicated themselves to eliminating the evil of those who are known to enjoy the torturing and suffering of others. In particular, they oppose members of the church of Loviatar and destroy them and their temples whenever possible. When servants of the other members of the Triad crusade against Loviatar''s servants, Noble Heart knights often join with them.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Noble Heart substitution level, a character must have Ilmater as her patron deity, be a member of the Companions of the Noble Heart, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Noble Heart substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class plus Survival.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.


Table: Noble Heart Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort

Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
3rd	+3	+3	+1	+1	Aura of courage, tenacious tracker	—
4th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Sunder the sadistic	Same as paladin
6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Delay poison 1/week	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Noble Heart substitution levels.

Tenacious Tracker (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a Noble Heart paladin gains the ability to follow the trail of those cruel enough to torture and maim others. She receives Track as a bonus feat. She gains a +10 competence bonus on Survival checks made to track those who have Loviatar as a patron deity.

Furthermore, whenever she physically touches the flesh of one who has been injured within the previous hour by someone who has Loviatar as his patron deity, she receives a clear mental image of that person''s true appearance.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s divine health class feature.

Sunder the Sadistic (Su): At 4th level, a Noble Heart paladin gains the ability to reduce to rubble objects and structures dedicated to evil. Whenever she attacks an object owned by a character who has Loviatar as a patron deity, or an object that is part of a temple or other structure dedicated to Loviatar, she can ignore the object''s hardness. She can also use her smite evil class ability against such objects as if they were evil creatures.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s ability to turn undead.

Delay Poison (Sp): The enemies of the Noble Heart paladin frequently employ poison in their efforts to spread evil and cruelty. Starting at 6th level, a Noble Heart paladin can use a delay poison effect once per week using her paladin level as her caster level.

This benefit replaces the remove disease class feature gained by a standard paladin. If she would later gain extra weekly uses of remove disease, the Noble Heart paladin instead gains extra weekly uses of delay poison.


Paladins of Freedom, Slaughter, and Tyranny
The three paladin variants presented here demonstrate examples of alternative-alignment paladins. Each one follows a specific code of conduct tailored to its specific alignment. The paladin of freedom is chaotic good, dedicated to liberty and free thought. The paladin of tyranny is the opposite, a lawful evil villain bent on dominating those weaker than she. The paladin of slaughter is a brutal champion of chaos and evil who leaves only destruction trailing in his wake. (If you use these versions of the paladin class, you might consider designating the standard paladin as the "paladin of honor" to differentiate it from the variants.)

These paladin variants aren''t meant to be unique classes in and of themselves, but rather alignment-based variations of the paladin. They have the same Hit Die, skill points per level, weapon and armor proficiencies, and spells per day as the standard paladin. Their class skill lists are nearly identical, with exceptions noted below. Their spellcasting functions identically to that of the standard paladin (though their spell lists are somewhat different). When a class feature has the same name as a paladin class feature, it functions the same as the one described for the standard paladin.

PALADIN OF FREEDOM
Class Skills
Replace Diplomacy with Bluff on the class skill list.

Class Features
The paladin of freedom has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.

Aura of Resolve (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of freedom is immune to compulsion effects. Each ally within 10 feet of him gains a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against compulsion effects. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin''s aura of courage class feature.

Spellcasting: Remove the following spells from the paladin''s spell list: death ward, discern lies, dispel chaos, magic circle against chaos, protection from chaos.

Add the following spells to the paladin''s spell list:

1st -�protection from law;�

3rd - magic circle against law, remove curse;�

4th - dispel law, freedom of movement.

Code of Conduct
A paladin of freedom must be of chaotic good alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. Additionally, a paladin of freedom''s code requires that he respect individual liberty, help those in need (provided they do not use the help for lawful or evil ends), and punish those who threaten or curtail personal liberty.

Associates
While he may adventure with characters of any good or neutral alignment, a paladin of freedom will never knowingly associate with evil characters (except on some sort of undercover mission), nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin of freedom may accept only henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are chaotic good.

PALADIN OF SLAUGHTER
Class Skills
Replace Diplomacy with Intimidate on the class skill list.

Class Features
The paladin of slaughter has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.

Aura of Evil (Ex): The power of a paladin of slaughter''s aura of evil (see the detect evil spell) is equal to her paladin of slaughter level, just as with the aura of a cleric of an evil deity.

Detect Good (Sp): At will, a paladin of slaughter can use detect good, as the spell.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day, a paladin of slaughter may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. This ability is otherwise identical to the standard paladin''s ability to smite evil, including increased daily uses as the paladin of slaughter gains class levels.

Deadly Touch (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin of slaughter can cause wounds with a successful touch attack. Each day she can deal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level x her Charisma bonus. An opponent subjected to this attack can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin level + paladin''s Cha modifier) to halve the damage dealt.

Alternatively, a paladin of slaughter can use any or all of this power to cure damage to undead creatures, just as an inflict wounds spell does. This power otherwise functions identically to the paladin''s lay on hands ability.

Debilitating Aura (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of slaughter radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of her to take a -1 penalty to Armor Class. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin''s aura of courage class feature.

Rebuke Undead (Su): A paladin of slaughter rebukes undead rather than turning undead.

Cause Disease (Sp): A paladin of slaughter can inflict disease with her touch (as the contagion spell) a number of times per week that a standard paladin of her level would normally be able to remove disease.

Spellcasting: Replace the standard paladin''s spell list with the following spell list:

1st - bane, cause fear, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, endure elements, inflict light wounds,�magic weapon,� protection from good, protection from law,�read magic, resistance, virtue;

2nd - bull''s strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle''s splendor, inflict moderate wounds, owls wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment;

3rd - blindness/deafness, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount,�inflict serious wounds, magic circle against good/law, prayer;�

4th - break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel good, dispel law, inflict critical wounds, poison, unholy sword.

Code of Conduct
A paladin of slaughter must be of chaotic evil alignment and loses all class abilities if she ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of slaughter''s code requires that she disrespect all authority figures who have not proven their physical superiority to her, refuse help to those in need, and sow destruction and death at all opportunities.

Associates
While she may adventure with characters of any evil or neutral alignment, a paladin of slaughter will never knowingly associate with good characters, nor will she continue an association with someone who consistently offends her moral code. A paladin of slaughter may accept only henchmen, followers, and cohorts who are chaotic evil.

PALADIN OF TYRANNY
Class Features
The paladin of tyranny has all the standard paladin class features, except as noted below.

Aura of Evil (Ex): The power of a paladin of tyranny''s aura of evil (see the�detect evil spell) is equal to his paladin of tyranny level, just as with the aura of a cleric of an evil deity.

Detect Good (Sp): At will, a paladin of tyranny can use�detect good, as the spell.

Smite Good (Su): Once per day, a paladin of tyranny may attempt to smite good with one normal melee attack. This ability is otherwise identical to the standard paladin''s ability to smite evil, including increased daily uses as the paladin of tyranny gains class levels.

Deadly Touch (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin of tyranny can cause wounds with a successful touch attack. Each day she can deal a total number of hit points of damage equal to her paladin level × her Charisma bonus. An opponent subjected to this attack can make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 paladin level paladin''s Cha modifier) to halve the damage dealt.

Alternatively, a paladin of tyranny can use any or all of this power to cure damage to undead creatures, just as an�inflict wounds spell does. This power otherwise functions identically to the paladin''s lay on hands ability.

Aura of Despair (Su): Beginning at 3rd level, a paladin of tyranny radiates a malign aura that causes enemies within 10 feet of him to take a -2 penalty on all saving throws. This ability otherwise functions identically to the paladin''s aura of courage class feature.

Rebuke Undead (Su): A paladin of tyranny rebukes undead rather than turning undead.

Cause Disease (Sp): A paladin of tyranny can inflict disease with his touch (as the�contagion spell) a number of times per week that a standard paladin of her level would normally be able to remove disease.

Spellcasting: Replace the paladin''s spell list with the following spell list:

1st - bane, corrupt weapon, create water, curse water, detect poison, detect undead, divine favor, doom, endure elements, inflict light wounds, magic weapon, protection from chaos, protection from good, read magic, resistance, virtue;�

2nd - bull''s strength, cure light wounds, darkness, delay poison, eagle''s splendor, hold person, inflict moderate wounds, owl''s wisdom, resist energy, undetectable alignment;�

3rd - bestow curse, cure moderate wounds, deeper darkness, discern lies, dispel magic, greater magic weapon, heal mount,�inflict serious wounds, magic circle against chaos/good, prayer;�

4th - break enchantment, cure serious wounds, dispel chaos, dispel good, dominate person, inflict critical wounds, unholy sword.

Code of Conduct
A paladin of tyranny must be of lawful evil alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits a good act. Additionally, a paladin of tyranny''s code requires that he respect authority figures as long as they have the strength to rule over the weak, act with discipline (not engaging in random slaughter, keeping firm control over those beneath his station, and so forth), help only those who help him maintain or improve his status, and punish those who challenge authority (unless, of course, such challengers prove more worthy to hold that authority).

Associates
While he may adventure with characters of any evil or neutral alignment, a paladin of tyranny will never knowingly associate with good characters unless it serves his needs, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A paladin of tyranny may accept henchmen and followers of any alignment, but may only accept cohorts who are lawful evil.

Paladin of Light
While the paladin usually focuses his holy crusades against the forces of evil, some paladins find themselves drawn into the war between darkness and light. While there are certainly similarities that can be drawn between darkness and evil, the paladin of light sees darkness as a force that transcends the evil of mortals and encompasses loss, suffering, and woe. The paladin of light, being an ally of the sun, also receives gifts to help withstand its heat.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a paladin of light substitution level, a character must come from a sun-centered society or worship a sun deity, and must be about to take her 1st, 2nd, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Paladin of light substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard paladin class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times that number as a beginning character).


Table: Paladin of Light Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort

Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+0	+0	Aura of good, detect night creature, smite evil 1/day	—
2th	+2	+3	+0	+0	Cooling touch, divine grace	—
6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Remove curse 1/week	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the paladin of light''s substitution levels.

Detect Night Creature (Sp): At will, a paladin of light can detect night creature, as the spell.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s detect evil class feature gained at 1st level.

Cooling Touch (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a paladin of light with a Charisma score of 12 or higher can provide creatures with fire resistance by touch. Each day she can grant a total number of points of fire resistance equal to her paladin level × her Charisma bonus. This fire resistance lasts for 10 minutes per paladin level.

For example, a 7th-level paladin of light with a 16 Charisma (+3 bonus) can provide up to 21 points of fire resistance per day. A paladin of light may choose to divide her points of fire resistance among multiple recipients, and she doesn''t have to use it all at once. Using cooling touch is a standard action.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s lay on hands class feature.

Remove Curse (Sp): At 6th level, a paladin of light can produce a remove curse effect, as the spell, once per week. She can use this ability one additional time per week for every three levels after 6th (twice per week at 9th, three times per week at 12th, and so forth).

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s remove disease class feature.

Pelor''s Blessing
A lightbringer paladin excels at slaying the undead. When he channels energy to smite his foes, the power he summons proves doubly effective against the living dead.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: Divine health.

Benefit: A lightbringer paladin who uses his smite evil ability against undead gains an additional +2 bonus to the attack roll and deals an extra 1 point of damage per two paladin levels. For example, a 13th-level lightbringer paladin armed with a longsword would deal 1d8+19 points of damage when using her smite evil ability against an undead, plus any additional bonuses for high Strength or magical effects that would normally apply. This is an extraordinary ability.

Planar Paladin
Dedicated to upholding law, promoting good, and serving as an example for others in the name of their god, paladins seem to live their lives as an effort to carry a tiny bit of their deity''s plane wherever they go. If they have done their jobs well, spending time on the plane in question will be like coming home, and bringing that same sense of beneficial transformation to other planes will be a worthwhile challenge for a truly worthy champion. Better than members of any other class, paladins can be agents who embody the tenets of an entire plane of existence.

Alignment: Lawful good.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a paladin planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 4th, 6th, or 10th level of paladin.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Paladin planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

10th	+10/+5	+7	+3	+3	Alignment purity	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the paladin''s planar substitution levels.

Smite Evil Outsider (Su): A planar paladin of 4th level or higher can attempt to smite an evil outsider with one normal melee attack. She adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to the damage dealt by the attack. In addition, the attack is treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. If the paladin accidentally smites a creature that is not an evil outsider, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up. A paladin may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Cha modifier (minimum 1).

If the paladin is on a plane that is both good-aligned and lawful-aligned (such as the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia), she also adds her Charisma bonus (if any) to the attack roll.

A planar paladin can use smite evil and smite evil outsider on the same attack, and the bonuses stack.

This benefit replaces the ability to turn undead gained by a standard paladin at 4th level.

Celestial Mount: A paladin who chooses this planar substitution benefit at 6th level may apply the celestial template to her special mount.

The mount gains darkvision out to 60 feet, spell resistance equal to its Hit Dice + 5 (maximum 25), and resistance to acid, cold, and electricity 5 (or resistance 10 if it has 8 or more Hit Dice). If the mount has 4 or more Hit Dice, it also gains damage reduction (5/magic for Hit Dice 4 to 11, or 10/magic for Hit Dice 12 or more), and its natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. It also gains a smite evil attack, allowing it to deal extra damage once per day equal to its Hit Dice (maximum +20) with a single melee attack against an evil foe.

This benefit replaces the remove disease class feature gained by a standard paladin at 6th level. From now on, whenever the paladin gains a standard paladin level that allows her to use remove disease more frequently, she gains the indicated number of uses per week minus 1 (1/week at 9th level, 2/week at 12th level, and so on).

Alignment Purity (Ex): A 10th-level paladin who chooses this planar substitution benefit can ignore the penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and/or Charisma-based checks that she would normally take when on a plane that is chaotic- or evil-aligned. Her spirit and determination are so pure that she effectively brings her own planar alignment traits wherever she goes.

This ability only affects the paladin, not any other allies or foes in her vicinity.

This benefit replaces the ability to smite evil three times per day gained by a standard paladin at 10th level. From now on, whenever the paladin gains a standard paladin level that allows her to smite evil more frequently, she gains the indicated number of uses per day minus 1 (3/day at 15th level, 4/day at 20th level, and so on).

Power of the Self
Paladins are hardest hit by becoming lost ones. They lose the strict rigidity of their knightly nature and are cast out into the world without a moral guide or a strong sense of who they are. Lost one paladins lose many of the blessings bestowed upon them by their deities, and must adapt to a life where their personal skills are more important than their divine gifts.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain divine grace, divine health, or your special mount. If you have already gained one or more of these abilities before becoming a lost one, you immediately lose access to them upon becoming a lost one.

Benefit: At 4th level and every four levels thereafter (8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th), you gain a fighter bonus feat, just as if you had taken levels in fighter.

Rebuke Dragons
Though the destruction (or control) of undead is common to many divinely oriented characters, the deities also recognize the ancient power of the dragons as a primal force. Some reward their followers with the ability to instill such creatures with awe or command them as minions.

Class: Cleric or paladin.

Level: 1st (cleric) or 4th (paladin).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the ability to turn or rebuke undead.

Benefit: You channel divine energy to rebuke (awe) or command (control) dragons. This ability functions as an evil cleric rebuking undead.

It is more difficult to rebuke or command dragons that share your moral or ethical bent. Any dragon that shares one alignment component with you is treated as having turn resistance +2 against this ability. Any dragon that shares both alignment components with you is treated as having turn resistance +4 against this ability.

You can also use this ability to bolster a dragon against an attempt by another creature to use its own rebuke dragons ability (the same way an evil cleric can bolster undead against turning). To bolster a dragon, you must share at least one alignment component with the dragon.

An attempt to rebuke dragons counts as an attempt to turn or rebuke undead for the purpose of qualifying for or activating divine feats, or for using other abilities that require you to expend a use of your turn or rebuke ability.

Red Falcon
Members of the Order of the Red Falcon serve the Red Knight and have earned fame in Tethyr for their heroics. They have a reputation for being excellent military tacticians, and even their followers are a cut above the norm.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Red Falcon substitution level, a character must have the Red Knight as her patron deity, be a member of the Order of the Red Falcon, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 2nd, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Red Falcon substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class plus Knowledge (history).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Military knowledge, remove disease 1/week, spontaneous extend spell, trained militia	See text
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Red Falcon substitution levels.

Brilliant Strategy (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, a Red Falcon can draw upon her instinct for battle to give her an amazing ability to predict the imminent actions of her enemies and her best options for taking advantage of those actions. Activating this ability is an immediate action; it grants her an insight bonus to AC equal to her Charisma bonus (if any) for 1 round. A Red Falcon can use this ability a number of times per day equal to one-half her class level.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s divine grace class feature.

Expanded Spell List: At 4th level, a Red Falcon adds augury (2nd level), deathwatch (1st level), and status (2nd level) to her paladin spell list.

Military Knowledge (Ex): Each time a Red Falcon substitution level is taken, the character gains a cumulative +2 competence bonus on Knowledge checks concerning military history or strategy.

Turn Undead (Su): A Red Falcon is not as skilled at turning undead as a normal paladin. She can only use this ability a number of times per day equal to her Charisma modifier.

Spontaneous Extend Spell (Su): At 6th level, once per day a Red Falcon can cast one of her spells as if she had prepared it with the Extend Spell feat. Doing this does not require a higher-level slot or increase the casting time for the spell.

This class feature replaces the 1st-level spell slot normally gained at 6th level. From this point forward, a Red Falcon has one less 1st-level paladin spell slot than normal.

Trained Militia: At 6th level, due to her leadership and skill at war, all cohorts and followers of the Red Falcon are treated as if they had Martial Weapon Proficiency in a single weapon of the Red Falcon''s choice. This benefit remains as long as the cohorts and followers remain in her service and as long as she meets with them at least once a month to refresh their training. If more than a month goes by without such a meeting, the cohorts and followers lose this proficiency until she has the opportunity to train them again. A Red Falcon can grant different weapon proficiencies to different cohorts and followers (they don''t all have to gain longsword proficiency, for example).

Ruby Rose Knight
Members of Sune''s order of paladins, the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, are known for their charm, beauty, and aversion to ugliness and evil. They use the power of love to destroy evil and hideous things, and they draw strength from their many romances.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Ruby Rose Knight substitution level, a character must have Sune as her patron, be a member of the Sisters and Brothers of the Ruby Rose, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 6th, or 12th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Ruby Rose Knight substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin class plus Bluff and Perform (dance, oratory, sing, and string instruments).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

12th	+12/+7/+2	+8	+4	+4	Heroic rapture	See text
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Ruby Rose Knight substitution levels.

Enduring Personality (Su): A 3rd-level Ruby Rose Knight is immune to any effect that would deal Charisma damage or Charisma drain.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s divine health class feature.

Expanded Spell List: At 3rd level, a Ruby Rose Knight adds love bite to her paladin spell list (even though she can''t actually cast the spell herself until at least 4th level).

Heroism (Sp): At 6th level, a Ruby Rose Knight can use a heroism effect once per week, using her class level as her caster level. She can''t use this spell-like ability on herself, only on another creature.

This benefit replaces the remove disease class feature gained by a standard paladin. If she would later gain extra weekly uses of remove disease, a Ruby Rose Knight instead gains extra weekly uses of heroism.

Heroic Rapture (Su): At 12th level, once per day a Ruby Rose Knight can spend a full-round action embracing another creature to grant it great bravery. The affected creature gains a +4 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks, immunity to fear effects, and a number of temporary hit points equal to the Ruby Rose Knight''s paladin level. The effect lasts for 1 minute.

This benefit replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard paladin at 12th level. From this point on, a Ruby Rose Knight has one less 3rd-level spell slot than normal.

Sentinel
The sentinel is a wandering crusader who often lives the life of a nomad, sleeping under the stars and taking what sustenance he can from the natural world. He does so in order to patrol the breadth of the world, constantly watching for incursions from the Lower Planes. The sentinel finds the endless hordes of demons, devils, and other fiends to be the most offensive and dangerous threat to life, and he has sacrificed much in order to become the perfect warrior, dedicated to preventing them from gaining any further hold on the world he loves.

To the sentinel, evil is simply that: evil. It can be hidden under a haze of entropy and chaos, it can masquerade under a hundred diabolically written laws, or it can revel in the truth of its cruelty. It makes no difference to the sentinel, nor do the methods he uses to combat it. Often, a sentinel uses the laws of the land and local governments to fight against incursions of evil, but just as often, he is forced to fight alone, against established tradition, and against the will of society. The fight against evil is treacherous though, for the sentinel must take care to protect that which is good and pure in the world, lest he become that which he loathes.

Sentinels are always neutral good. They usually worship good deities that have loosely organized churches. Sentinels form into loosely knit groups that rarely, if ever, physically meet. When they do meet. the meetings take place in large lodges and are both brief and to the point. Sentinels prefer to communicate with their kin via an elaborate network of trail glyphs and markers. They enjoy the company of druids and rangers, and they often work with members of those classes to accomplish a common goal.

Alignment: Neutral good.

Hit Die: d10.

Class Skills
The sentinel''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (religion) (Int), Knowledge (the planes) (Int), Listen (Wis), Profession (Wis). Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spot (Wis), and Survival (Wis).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the sentinel.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sentinels are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, medium, and light), and with shields (except tower shields).

Aura of Good (Ex): The power of a sentinel''s aura of good (see the detect good spell) is equal to his sentinel level, just like the aura of a cleric of a good deity.

Detect Evil (Sp): At will, a sentinel can detect evil, as the spell.

Smite Evil (Su): A sentinel''s smite targets all evil creatures, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Divine Grace (Su): A sentinel gains this ability at 2nd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Resist Fiendish Lure (Su): At 2nd level, a sentinel gains a +4 sacred bonus to all saving throws against mind-affecting attacks of evil outsiders.

Aura of Courage (Su): A sentinel gains this ability at 3rd level, which functions as the paladin ability of the same name.

Celestial Fortitude (Su): At 3rd level, a sentinel''s endurance and fortitude are enhanced against fiendish attacks. He gains a +2 sacred bonus to all Fortitude saving throws against effects from evil outsiders and evil spells. Additionally, if he makes a successful Fortitude saving throw against an effect from an evil spell or evil outsider that normally deals half damage or partial effects on a successful save, he instead takes no damage and suffers no partial effects.

Turn Outsider (Su): When a sentinel reaches 4th level, he gains the supernatural ability to turn or destroy outsiders by channeling energy. The sentinel can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. The sentinel turns outsiders as a cleric three levels lower would turn undead.

Celestial Minion (Sp): Upon reaching 5th level, a sentinel gains the ability to summon a Medium or smaller size celestial animal (with the celestial creature template) as a standard action usable once a day. This celestial minion carries the same responsibilities as a paladin''s special mount and gains the same bonuses to its HD, natural armor, Strength, Intelligence, and other special abilities that a paladin''s special mount gains as the sentinel increases in level. Unlike the paladin''s special mount, the celestial minion only remains for 1 hour/level before returning to the outer plane from whence it came.

Dispel Evil (Sp): At 8th level, a sentinel gains the ability to dispel evil, as the spell, once per week. He may use this ability an additional time each week every additional four levels, to a maximum of 4 times a week at 20th level.

Code of Conduct
A sentinel must be of neutral good alignment and loses all class abilities if he ever willingly commits an evil act. The sentinel is most at home in the wilderness of the Material Plane. He only journeys into cities when absolutely necessary, and he avoids travel to other planes except in the most dire need, since his vows require him to battle evil on his home plane. These vows call for him to protect the natural order of the Material Plane from becoming influenced or tainted by the forces of the evil Outer Planes. Additionally, the sentinel is honor-bound to provide assistance to any non-outsider who becomes lost or endangered while in the wilderness, as long as the victim in need honors the sanctity of the wilderness.

Associates
A sentinel can adventure with characters of any non-evil alignment but remains suspicious and wary of those who draw their powers from the evil outer planes. He tolerates the presence of native evil outsiders, such as tieflings, but would prefer not to share their company if possible. He never knowingly associates with evil characters, nor will he continue an association with someone who consistently offends his moral code. A sentinel may only accept henchmen, followers, or cohorts who are neutral good.

Sentinel Spell List
Sentinels choose their spells from the following list:

1st Level: Bless, bless water, bless weapon. cure light wounds, detect poison, divine favor, endure elements, hold portal, magic weapon, protection from evil, protection from good, remove fear, shield of faith, summon monster I.

2nd Level: Align weapon, bear''s endurance, bull''s strength, consecrate, eagle''s splendor, lesser restoration, shield other, spiritual weapon, summon monster II.

3rd Level: Cure moderate wounds, daylight, dispel magic, invisibility purge, magic circle against evil, prayer, remove blindness/deafness, remove curse, remove disease, summon monster III.

4th Level: Break enchantment, cure serious wounds, death ward, dimensional anchor, dismissal, freedom of movement, holy sword, neutralize poison, restoration, summon monster IV.

Shadow Cloak Knight
For many decades, the gnome paladins belonging to the Knights of the Shadowy Cloak have worked to eliminate evil humanoids. To minimize the possibility of retaliation against gnome communities, they have developed ways to work in secret.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Shadow Cloak Knight substitution level, a character must be a gnome, a member of the Knights of the Shadowy Cloak, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and about to take her 4th, 6th, or 9th level of paladin.

Class Skills
A Shadow Cloak Knight has the same class skills as a standard paladin does, plus Hide and Move Silently.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

9th	+9/+4	+6	+3	+3	One with the darkness 1/day	Same as paladin
Class Features
All the following are features of the Shadow Cloak Knight substitution levels.

Favored Enemy (Ex): A Shadow Cloak Knight paladin trains to fight the gnomes'' traditional enemies and learns special tactics to defeat them. She gains humanoids as her favored enemy type and can choose any of the humanoid subtypes indicated for rangers. The Shadow Cloak Knight gains a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against her favored enemy and a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): A 6th-level Shadow Cloak Knight can use her Hide skill even when she has nothing to hide behind, or when she is being observed. To do so, she must be within 10 feet of any area of shadowy illumination in which she could hide, or in the dark. She cannot hide in her own shadow, and she can hide in the shadow of a creature only if it is Large or larger. She cannot use a creature''s own shadow to hide from it.

One with the Darkness (Sp): Once per day, a Shadow Cloak Knight paladin can become invisible, as if using the 2nd level sorcerer/wizard spell invisibility. Caster level equals paladin level, and Shadow Cloak Knight substitution levels count as paladin levels for this purpose.

Smiting Arrow
You belong to a sacred group, of priests who specialize in the use of ranged weapons.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain proficiency with heavy armor or shields.

Benefit: You gain the ability to smite evil with a ranged attack up to 30 feet.

Solstice Knight
During the winter solstice, when the forces of light ebb before soundless legions of darkness, a handful of champions maintain a long and lonely vigil. Their prayers, fervent denials of the forces of evil, help to sustain the mortal realm through its time of trial. In the morning, when the rooster crows and the dawn begins its inexorable march toward the triumph of midsummer, they sometimes find their faith rewarded in unusual ways.

A paladin who endures one of these vigils gains the option of choosing solstice knight substitution levels.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a solstice knight substitution level, a character must be a paladin about to take her 3rd or 5th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Solstice knight substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard paladin class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

3rd	+3	+3	+1	+1	Aura of courage, blessed radiance	—
5th	+5	+4	+1	+1	Darkvision, strike of the faithful, special mount	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the solstice knight''s substitution levels.

Blessed Radiance (Sp): Embraced by the risen sun, a 3rd-level solstice knight carries a light deep within her soul, a radiance she pledges to bear into places of darkness and terror. She gains the ability to create a glorious, swirling aura of light, painting the area around her with a magnificent cascade of silver and gold. As a free action, a solstice knight may cast daylight, centered upon herself, a number of times per day equal to her uses of smite evil. (The two effects are not related - they merely have an equal number of uses.) Her caster level equals her paladin level.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s divine health class feature.

Darkvision (Ex): At 5th level the solstice knight also gains darkvision with a range of 30 feet. If she already possesses darkvision she instead increases the range of her darkvision by 30 feet.

Strike of the Faithful (Su): A solstice knight can channel the titanic power of the sun''s righteous light. Whenever the paladin uses his smite evil ability against an evil undead creature he deals double the smite damage.

The paladin loses one daily use of smite evil from her total number of uses when she gains this ability. Thereafter she has one fewer use per day (only two at 10th level, for example).

Special Mounts
The list below is a compilation of all creatures eligible to be chosen as special mounts, organized by minimum paladin level required. Apply the parenthetical adjustment to the paladin''s level for purposes of determining the special mount''s characteristics and special abilities.

1 Small rider.

2 Available only in an aquatic environment.

3 Traditionally, unicorns only allow female human or female elf riders.

Stand Fast
While most paladins enjoy the companionship of a summoned mount, those who live amidst large populations often prefer to devote their energies toward protecting those around them and defending the city from outside threats.

Class: Paladin.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a special mount.

Benefit: Starting at 5th level, a paladin may use the following two abilities, once per day each, as an immediate action. At 11th level, she may use each ability twice per day, and at 18th level she may use each ability three times per day.

Add the paladin''s divine grace (Charisma modifier) on the saving throw of all allies within 20 feet. She must add this bonus on the same save for each of them; thus, she could add to everyone''s Reflex save, or everyone''s Will save, but she could not grant some a bonus on Reflex and others a bonus on Will. She does not gain any bonus for using this ability, but neither does she lose her own divine grace bonus. This bonus lasts for 1 round.
Add the paladin''s divine grace (Charisma modifier) on any roll she makes to resist a bull rush, disarm, grapple, sunder, or trip attack. She cannot use this ability when she is making such an attack; it is defensive only.
Sword of Celestia
Celestial weaponsmiths of the Upper Planes forge a weapon on your behalf.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: If you choose this ability, you do not gain the special mount ability.

Benefit: Choose a specific kind of weapon, such as "longsword." A powerful good outsider crafts a weapon of this kind for you. The weaponsmith requires you give the weapon a name (often the name of a celestial paragon, saint, or heroic ideal, although you are free to name the weapon whatever you''d like). You can summon the weapon to your hand or return it to its resting place in the celestial forges as a free action, and you can call it to your hand even if it is not in its resting place (such as if you have been disarmed). You may call this weapon a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1/day).

Whatever its kind, the weapon is of intricate and unearthly beauty, although you are bound by oath never to sell the weapom or give it to any other creature (even to loan it to a friend). The weapon is a +1 weapon of its kind at 5th level. At 10th level, it becomes a +2 weapon, at 15th level it becomes a +2 holy weapon, and at 20th level it becomes a +2 holy lawful weapon. It overcomes damage reduction as if it were good aligned and cure spells and other healing magic repair damage to it as if it were a living creature. You may expend gold and XP to enhance the weapon as if you had the Craft Magic Arms and Armor feat (on top of what the weapon is through this ability).

If the weapon is ever destroyed, a different celestial weaponsmith crafts you a new weapon, presenting it to you a year and a day after your previous weapon was destroyed. You can choose a new kind of weapon or the same kind.


Underdark Knight
If you dedicate yourself to overcoming evil in the Underdark, you might find little use for the paladin''s most prized ally, the special mount. By giving up the ability to call this devoted creature, you become a more mobile and effective fighter underground.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the special mount class feature.

Benefit: Whenever you are underground, you can draw upon the earth to gain the following abilities. At 5th level, your base speed increases by 10 feet, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on Balance, Climb, and Jump checks. You also gain low-light vision that functions as long as you remain underground. If you already had low-light vision, you instead gain darkvision out to 60 feet while underground; if you already had darkvision, add 30 feet to its range.

At 7th level, you can use spike stones once per day, as the spell. This is a spell-like ability with caster level equal to your character level.

At 12th level, you gain the earth glide extraordinary ability, which enables you to move through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish moves through water (MM 98). If you end your movement inside earth or stone, however, you begin to suffocate (DMG 304).

At 15th level, you can use dimension door, as the spell, once per day for every five paladin levels you possess. You must begin and end any such movement in contact with stone or earth. This is a spell-like ability with caster level equal to your character level.

4th	+4	+4	+1	+1	Awesome smite	Same as paladin
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Vigilant Eye substitution levels.

Know Greatest Enemy (Su): A Vigilant Eye automatically knows which enemy in her presence is the most powerful (in game terms, which enemy has the highest CR). This benefit applies only to enemies that she can see that are within 60 feet of her. She does not need to use an action to know this, and this sense updates automatically if current foes leave or die or if new opponents arrive. She doesn''t know why the most powerful enemy is such (for example, she wouldn''t know that the most powerful orc in a patrol was a 3rd-level barbarian), just that it is so. She doesn''t know exactly how tough this enemy is, but does know if that enemy is significantly more powerful than her (in game terms, if its CR is 4 or more above her effective character level).

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s detect evil class feature.

Expanded Spell List: A Vigilant Eye adds see invisibility (2nd level) to her paladin spell list.

Vigilant Aid (Su): Starting at 3rd level, when a Vigilant Eye uses the aid another special attack in melee combat to give an ally a bonus to his AC, she only has to spend a move action rather than a standard action. She can use more than one aid another special attack in a single round, but no ally can be aided more than once per round in this fashion.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s divine health class feature.

Awesome Smite (Su): At 4th level, a Vigilant Eye gains the ability to repel enemies with powerful holy power. As a standard action, she can spend a daily smite evil attempt and strike an evil creature as if she had the Awesome Blow feat, even if she does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat. Note that the paladin doesn''t also gain the normal benefit of smite evil. She is treated as if one size category larger than normal for determining which creatures she can affect with this ability. If she accidentally uses this ability against a creature that isn''t evil, she deals normal damage but the Awesome Blow effect is not triggered, and it still counts as one of her daily uses of smite evil.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s turn undead class feature.

Warded Special Mount
The lightbringer paladin is a special, favored warrior of light. The gods protect his special mount so that the powers of darkness cannot easily defeat him.

Level: 6th.

Replaces: One weekly use of remove disease.

Benefit: In addition to the standard qualities of a special mount, a lightbringer paladin''s mount is immune to all death spells, magical death effects, energy drain, and any negative energy effects (such as from inflict spells or chill touch).


Warforged Paladin
The rare warforged who takes up a paladin''s path likely follows no deity. With no assurance of divinity or even the existence of their own souls, warforged paladins often follow a simple faith of good will. Believing in the necessity for just and benign behavior and the benefits of living in such a fashion, these warforged paladins can gain abilities uncommon for the class and unique to their race.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a warforged paladin substitution level, a character must be a warforged about to take his 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level of paladin.

Class Skills
Warforged paladin substitution levels grant the following class skills: Concentration, Craft, Knowledge (nobility and royalty), Knowledge (religion), Profession, and Ride.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the warforged paladin''s racial substitution levels.

Smite Construct (Su): A warforged paladin can use his smite evil ability against a construct, gaining a bonus on his attack rolls and damage rolls as if smiting an evil creature, regardless of the construct''s alignment.

Durable Will (Su): At 2nd level, a warforged paladin gains a bonus equal to his Constitution bonus (if any) on Will saves.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s divine grace ability.

Repair Damage (Su): Beginning at 2nd level, a warforged paladin with a Constitution score of 12 or higher can repair damage dealt to any construct or living construct (including himself) by touch. Each day he can repair a total number of hit points of damage equal to his paladin level × his Constitution bonus. For example, a 7th-level warforged paladin with this substitution feature and a Constitution score of 16 can repair 21 points of damage per day. A warforged paladin can choose to divide his repair ability among multiple recipients, and he doesn''t have to use it all at once. Using repair damage is a standard action.

Alternatively, a warforged paladin can use any or all of this power on living creatures, healing damage equal to one-half the number of points of repair expended. Unlike the paladin''s lay on hands ability, this ability cannot be used to deal damage to undead.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s lay on hands ability.

Immunity to Stunning (Ex): From 3rd level on, a warforged paladin cannot be stunned.

This substitution feature replaces the standard paladin''s divine health ability.

Warrior Paladin
The paladin is a hybrid class, in that he combines martial talents with spellcasting and other abilities. To make this class fit better into a warrior-focused campaign, consider using the following variant that trades the class'' spellcasting powers for other extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. In general, this variant class gives up the versatility of daily spell selection in exchange for more powerful or reliable special abilities.

This variant paladin gains all the normal class features of the paladin, with the following changes and additions:

Spells: The paladin does not gain the ability to cast divine spells.

Blessed Weapon (Su): Any melee weapon wielded by a paladin of 6th level or higher is treated as good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

Divine Might (Su): At 11th level and higher, the paladin can use a standard action to add a +4 bonus to her Strength, Wisdom, or Charisma score. This ability may be used once per day, and its effect lasts for 1 minute per class level.

Tend to Mount (Su): A paladin of 13th level or higher who uses her lay on hands ability to heal her mount cures 5 points of damage per point of healing spent. In addition, the paladin may use her lay on hands ability to end any one of the following adverse conditions affecting her mount, at the cost of 5 points of healing per condition unless otherwise noted: ability damage (costs 1 point per ability point restored), blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, sickened, stunned, or poisoned.

The paladin can remove adverse conditions at the same time that she heals damage, but any points of healing spent to end adverse conditions don''t also cure hit point damage.

Holy Sword (Sp): At 16th level, a paladin gains the ability to use holy sword once per day, as a caster whose level is equal to one-half the paladin''s class level.

Wary Swordknight
Members of Arvoreen''s Marchers kept halfling villages safe during Tethyr''s Interregnum; the Wary Swordknights are the paladins of the order, and are known for their martial prowess and vigilant nature.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Wary Swordknight substitution level, a character must be a halfling, have Arvoreen as her patron deity, be a member of the Arvoreen''s Marchers order, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 4th, or 6th level of paladin.

Class Skills
Wary Swordknight substitution levels have the class skills of the standard paladin plus Listen and Spot.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifier.

6th	+6/+1	+5	+2	+2	Haste (self) 1/day	See text
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Wary Swordknight substitution levels.

Tougher than Small (Ex): When a Wary Swordknight is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and trip attempts), she is treated as one size larger if doing so is advantageous to her. A Wary Swordknight is also considered to be one size larger when determining whether a creature''s special attacks based on size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect her. The benefits of this class feature stack with effects that change her size category.

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s aura of courage class feature.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): At 4th level, a Swordknight gains uncanny dodge (as the barbarian class feature of the same name).

This benefit replaces the standard paladin''s turn undead class feature.

Haste (Sp): At 6th level, a Swordknight becomes able to use a haste effect on herself once per day. Her caster level for this ability is equal to one-half her paladin level.

This benefit replaces the 1st-level spell slot gained at 6th level, as well as the remove disease class feature normally gained at 6th level. From this point forward, a Wary Swordknight has one less weekly use of remove disease than normal.

Wayward Warden
Wayward Warden paladins dedicate their lives to defending halfling communities and trade caravans. Because they use both stealth and honorable confrontation to achieve their goals, paladins in this organization train in abilities that use the sneakiness of their companions to the group''s advantage.

Hit Die: d10.

Requirements
To take a Wayward Warden substitution level, a character must be a halfling, a member of the Wayward Wardens organization, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and about to take her 3rd, 5th, or 10th level of paladin.

Class Skills
A Wayward Warden has the same class skills as a standard paladin does.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

10th	+10/+5	+7	+3	+3	Commanding presence	Same as paladin
Class Features
All the following are features of the Wayward Warden substitution levels.

Distracting Presence (Su): When confronting evil, a Wayward Warden can focus the attention of her foes on herself, causing each of them to take a -4 penalty on Spot and Listen checks while she is present.

This benefit replaces the aura of courage class feature gained by a standard paladin at 3rd level.

Use Your Allies (Ex): When a Wayward Warden is flanking a foe at least one size category larger than herself, she deals an extra +1d6 points of damage on every attack. This extra damage applies even if the foe cannot be flanked or is immune to flanking, but it does not apply when the foe is simply denied its Dexterity bonus. Use your allies is otherwise the same as the rogue sneak attack ability.

This benefit replaces the second daily use of smite evil that a standard paladin gains at 5th level. From this point onward, she has one fewer daily use of smite evil than a standard paladin does.

Commanding Presence (Su): A 10th-level Wayward Warden can influence the battlefield with her very presence. Once per day, as a standard action, she can grant her allies (but not herself) a competence bonus on attack rolls equal to her Charisma bonus (maximum +5). Only allies within 60 feet of the Wayward Warden that can see and hear her are eligible to receive this bonus. It lasts for 1 round per paladin level that the character possesses, and Wayward Warden substitution levels count as paladin levels for this purpose.

This benefit replaces the 3rd daily use of the smite evil ability that a standard paladin gains at 10th level. From this point forward, she has one fewer daily use of smite evil than a normal paladin does, or two fewer uses if she also took the 5th-level Wayward Warden substitution level.

Wyrmslayer
While any paladin might fight a dragon in the course of her battles against evil, wyrmslayer paladins dedicate their lives to learning about these powerful creatures and how to combat them most effectively. With your DM''s permission, you might consider making the following changes to emphasize a wyrmslayer paladin''s special characteristics:

Class Skills: Replace Knowledge (nobility and royalty) with Knowledge (arcana).

Resist Energy (Sp): Replace the ability to remove disease with the ability to cast resist energy 1/day with a caster level equal to your paladin level. Whenever you would gain an additional use of remove disease you instead gain an additional use of resist energy.

Multiclassing: A wyrmslayer paladin may multiclass freely in the ranger class, provided she selects dragons as her first favored enemy.',

    description = 'The forests are home to fierce and cunning creatures, such as bloodthirsty owlbears and malicious displacer beasts. But more cunning and powerful than these monsters is the ranger, a skilled hunter and stalker. He knows the woods as if they were his home (as indeed they are), and he knows his prey in deadly detail.

A ranger often accepts the role of protector, aiding those who live in or travel through the woods. In addition, a ranger carries grudges against certain types of creatures and looks for opportunities to find and destroy them. He may adventure for all the reasons that a fighter does.

A ranger can use a variety of weapons and is quite capable in combat. His skills allow him to survive in the wilderness, to find his prey, and to avoid detection. He also has special knowledge about certain types of creatures, which makes it easier for him to find and defeat such foes. Finally, an experienced ranger has such a tie to nature that he can actually draw upon natural power to cast divine spells, much as a druid does.

Rangers can be of any alignment. Most are good, and such rangers usually function as protectors of the wild areas. In this role, a ranger seeks out and destroys or drives off evil creatures that threaten the wilderness. Good rangers also protect those who travel through the wilderness, serving sometimes as guides and sometimes as unseen guardians. Most rangers are also chaotic, preferring to follow the ebb and flow of nature or of their own hearts instead of rigid rules. Evil rangers, though rare, are much to be feared. They revel in nature''s thoughtless cruelty and seek to emulate her most fearsome predators. They gain divine spells just as good rangers do, for nature herself is indifferent to good and evil.

Though a ranger gains his divine spells from the power of nature, he like anyone else may worship a chosen deity. Ehlonna (goddess of the woodlands) and Obad-Hai (god of nature) are the most common deities revered by, though some prefer more martial deities.

Some rangers gained their training as part of special military teams, but most learned their skills from solitary masters who accepted them as students and assistants. The rangers of a particular master may count themselves as cohorts, or they may be rivals for the status of best student and thus the rightful heir to their master''s fame.

Elves often choose the ranger''s path. They are at home in the woods, and they have the grace to move stealthily. Half-elves who feel their elf parents'' connection to the woods are also likely to adopt this class. Humans are often rangers as well, being adaptable enough to learn their way around the woods even if it doesn''t come naturally to them. Half-orcs may find the life of a ranger more comfortable than life among cruel and taunting humans (or orcs). Gnome rangers are more common than gnome fighters, but still they tend to remain in their own lands rather than adventure among "the big people." Dwarf rangers are rare, but they can be quite effective. Instead of living in the surface wilderness, they are at home in the endless caverns beneath the earth. Here they hunt down and destroy the enemies of dwarvenkind with the relentless precision for which dwarves are known. Dwarf rangers are often known as cavers. Halfling rangers are highly respected for their ability to help communities of halflings prosper as they pursue their nomadic lifestyle. Among the savage humanoids, only gnolls are commonly rangers, using their skills to slyly stalk their prey.

Rangers get along well with druids and to some extent with barbarians. They are known to bicker with paladins, mostly because they often share goals but differ in style, tactics, approach, philosophy, and esthetics. Since rangers don''t often look to other people for support or friendship, they find it easy to tolerate people who are quite different from themselves, such as bookish wizards and preachy clerics. They just don''t care enough to get upset about others'' differences.

The ranger''s best role is that of a scout and secondary combatant. Without the heavy armor of the fighter or the staying power of the barbarian, the ranger should focus on opportunistic and ranged attacks. Most rangers user their animal companions as sentries, scouts, or to assist them in melee combat.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d8.

Class Skills
The ranger''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Climb (Str), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Handle Animal (Cha), Heal (Wis), Hide (Dex), Jump (Str), Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int), Knowledge (geography) (Int), Knowledge (nature) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Profession (Wis), Ride (Dex), Search (Int), Spot (Wis), Survival (Wis), Swim (Str), and Use Rope (Dex).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the ranger.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A ranger is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with light armor and shields (except tower shields).

Favored Enemy (Ex): At 1st level, a ranger may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. The ranger gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, he gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, he must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on the table. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy, the ranger''s bonuses do not stack; he simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

Table: Ranger Favored Enemies

Type (Subtype)	Type (Subtype)	Type (Subtype)	Type (Subtype)
Aberration	Humanoid (dwarf)	Humanoid (reptilian)	Outsider (fire)
Animal	Humanoid (elf)	Magical beast	Outsider (good)
Construct	Humanoid (goblinoid)	Monstrous humanoid	Outsider (lawful)
Dragon	Humanoid (gnoll)	Ooze	Outsider (native)
Elemental	Humanoid (gnome)	Outsider (air)	Outsider (water)
Fey	Humanoid (halfling)	Outsider (chaotic)	Plant
Giant	Humanoid (human)	Outsider (earth)	Undead
Humanoid (aquatic)	Humanoid (orc)	Outsider (evil)	Vermin
Track: A ranger gains Track as a bonus feat.

Wild Empathy (Ex): A ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions just like a Diplomacy check to improve the attitude of a person. The ranger rolls 1d20 and adds his ranger level and his Charisma bonus to determine the wild empathy check result. The typical domestic animal has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild animals are usually unfriendly.

To use wild empathy, the ranger and the animal must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal visibility conditions. Generally, influencing an animal in this way takes 1 minute, but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.

The ranger can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2, but he takes a -4 penalty on the check.

Combat Style (Ex): At 2nd level, a ranger must select one of two combat styles to pursue: archery or two-weapon combat. This choice affects the character''s class features but does not restrict his selection of feats or special abilities in any way.

If the ranger selects archery, he is treated as having the Rapid Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selects two-weapon combat, he is treated as having the Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

The benefits of the ranger''s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

Endurance: A ranger gains Endurance as a bonus feat at 3rd level.

Animal Companion (Ex): At 4th level, a ranger gains an animal companion selected from the following list: badger, camel, dire rat, dog, riding dog, eagle, hawk, horse (light or heavy), owl, pony, snake (Small or Medium viper), or wolf. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the following creatures may be added to the ranger''s list of options: crocodile, porpoise, Medium shark, and squid. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.

This ability functions like the druid ability of the same name, except that the ranger''s effective druid level is one-half his ranger level. A ranger may select from the alternative lists of animal companions just as a druid can, though again his effective druid level is half his ranger level. Like a druid, a ranger cannot select an alternative animal if the choice would reduce his effective druid level below 1st.

Spells: Beginning at 4th level, a ranger gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells, which are drawn from the ranger spell list. A ranger must choose and prepare his spells in advance (see below).

To prepare or cast a spell, a ranger must have a Wisdom score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a ranger''s spell is 10 + the spell level + the ranger''s Wisdom modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a ranger can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Ranger. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Wisdom score. When Table: The Ranger indicates that the ranger gets 0 spells per day of a given spell level, he gains only the bonus spells he would be entitled to based on his Wisdom score for that spell level. The ranger does not have access to any domain spells or granted powers, as a cleric does.

A ranger prepares and casts spells the way a cleric does, though he cannot lose a prepared spell to cast a cure spell in its place. A ranger may prepare and cast any spell on the ranger spell list, provided that he can cast spells of that level, but he must choose which spells to prepare during his daily meditation.

Through 3rd level, a ranger has no caster level. At 4th level and higher, his caster level is one-half his ranger level.

Improved Combat Style (Ex): At 6th level, a ranger''s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Manyshot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

As before, the benefits of the ranger''s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

Woodland Stride (Ex): Starting at 7th level, a ranger may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at his normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. However, thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that are enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affect him.

Swift Tracker (Ex): Beginning at 8th level, a ranger can move at his normal speed while following tracks without taking the normal -5 penalty. He takes only a -10 penalty (instead of the normal -20) when moving at up to twice normal speed while tracking.

Evasion (Ex): At 9th level, a ranger can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If he makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, he instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the ranger is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless ranger does not gain the benefit of evasion.

Combat Style Mastery (Ex): At 11th level, a ranger''s aptitude in his chosen combat style (archery or two-weapon combat) improves again. If he selected archery at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Improved Precise Shot feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

If the ranger selected two-weapon combat at 2nd level, he is treated as having the Greater Two-Weapon Fighting feat, even if he does not have the normal prerequisites for that feat.

As before, the benefits of the ranger''s chosen style apply only when he wears light or no armor. He loses all benefits of his combat style when wearing medium or heavy armor.

Camouflage (Ex): A ranger of 13th level or higher can use the Hide skill in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain doesn''t grant cover or concealment.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): While in any sort of natural terrain, a ranger of 17th level or higher can use the Hide skill even while being observed.

Arcane Hunter
Rangers learn to track and hunt creatures of a certain type when choosing a favored enemy. Some rangers concern themselves less with what a creature is, and more with what it does. These rangers learn to identify signs of the arcane and make it their business to combat those who use arcane magic in opposition to their goals.

Class: Ranger.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: At 1st level, you do not select a favored enemy from Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, you can choose favored enemies as normal.

Benefit: At 1st level, you gain favored enemy (arcanists). This feature works just like the favored enemy ability. The bonuses granted apply to any character capable of casting arcane spells or using invocations (but not other spell-like abilities).

Aquatic Ranger
Rangers of the rivers and seas are often master sailors, expert in the use of watercraft both large and small. They paddle canoes through wild canyons, sail outriggers amid coral reefs, or pilot skiffs along rocky coasts. Among aquatic folk, rangers are hunters and trackers who have become specialized in following their prey through the challenging medium of water. Sahuagin in particular make dangerous aquatic rangers.

Track in Water: An aquatic ranger can follow a trail even across streams or underwater. Such terrain cannot hold tracks, but the ranger uses faint scent traces and lingering disturbances in the water to follow the recent passage of his quarry. Since water (especially if moving) quickly washes away the trail, the Survival DC modifier for tracking in water is +10. For each minute that passes since the trail was made, the DC also increases by 1 (or by 5 in flowing water). Tracking through rushing or stormy water is impossible, except to a character under the effect of a wake trailing spell.

Woodland Stride (Ex): A ranger who has a racial swim speed can choose to apply this ability to difficult aquatic terrain (shallow coral, kelp beds, ice-choked waters, sargasso, and similar obstacles), rather than woodland terrain. This choice is made when the class feature is gained.

Celestial Slayer
Rangers specialize in hunting and defeating certain sorts of foes. Sometimes, a ranger''s choice of enemy - as well as his single-minded pursuit of that enemy''s destruction - draws the dread attention of evil entities from the Lower Planes. The character becomes better able to resist and combat the forces of good, at the expense of his soul.

Class: Ranger.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: To select this alternative class feature, you must be evil. If your alignment changes to something other than evil, you lose access to this class feature until your alignment is restored to evil.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wild empathy, animal companion, or woodland stride.

Benefit: You gain spell resistance equal to 10 + your class level against spells and spell-like effects that have the good descriptor.

In addition, when you roll to confirm a critical hit against a creature of the good subtype, you gain a +4 competence bonus on the roll.

Champion of the Wild
By surrendering your spellcasting ability, you focus your energies on becoming a weapon master. You gain access to bonus feats much as a fighter does, but focused on your mastery of your chosen combat style.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: To select this class feature, you must sacrifice your spellcasting ability.

Benefit: You no longer gain spells as a ranger, but you can now select a bonus feat at 4th, 8th, 11th, and 14th levels. You can choose any feat from the following list for which you meet the prerequisites: Blind-Fight, Combat Expertise, Eyes in the Back of Your Head, Improved Disarm, Improved Favored Enemy, Improved Feint, and Improved Trip, as well as from one of the following lists, depending on your combat style.

Archery: Far Shot, Improved Precise Shot, Improved Rapid Shot, Manyshot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Ranged Disarm, Ranged Pin, Ranged Sunder, Sharp-Shooting, and Shot on the Run.

Two-Weapon Combat: Greater Two-Weapon Defense, Greater Two-Weapon Fighting, Improved Two-Weapon Defense, Improved Two-Weapon Fighting, Two-Weapon Defense, Weapon Finesse.

Special: A ranger who selects this path can no longer use scrolls, wands, or other magic items that require access to a spell list, unless he has another spellcasting class that grants access to the appropriate spells.

Combat Styles
The Player''s Handbook features two combat styles for rangers: archery and two-weapon fighting. History and fantasy abound with stories of hunters and woodsmen who master such weapons as the longbow, the quarterstaff, or the twin blades. However, rangers use many other weapons as well. This article presents five new combat styles for rangers to choose from. The ranger gains the listed feats for the chosen combat style at the appropriate levels, as described on Combat Style, Improved Combat Style, and Combat Style Mastery.

BEAST-WRESTLING STYLE
Some rangers eschew weapons and fight with their bare hands. Unlike the graceful style of the monk, the beast wrestler relies on his brute strength to subdue his foes. Originally practiced by rangers living in marshy areas to capture and move dangerous animals (such as crocodiles) without harming them, some adventurous rangers apply these techniques to more exotic foes. Most beast wrestlers choose animal or magical beast as their first favored enemy.

Combat Style (2nd): Improved Unarmed Strike

Improved Combat Style (6th): Improved Grapple

Combat Style Mastery (11th): Stunning Fist

MOUNTED-COMBAT STYLE
With their special rapport with animals, rangers readily take to riding. A mounted ranger can use her mount in combat, especially when she utilizes the mounted combat style. Such rangers often choose a horse, riding dog, or some exotic mount as an animal companion, and augment their style with feats from the Mounted Combat feat tree.

Combat Style (2nd): Ride-By Attack

Improved Combat Style (6th): Spirited Charge

Combat Style Mastery (11th): Trample

PISCATOR STYLE
Wielding a net in one hand and a melee weapon (typically a trident) in the other, a ranger trained in the piscator style attempts to entangle or trip his foes before striking in melee. Many masters of this style take Power Attack to deal more damage after successfully tripping a foe. Although originated by the sahuagin, rangers of other aquatic races, as well as coastal fishers and even some gladiators, have adopted this style.

Combat Style (2nd): Exotic Weapon Proficiency (net)

Improved Combat Style (6th): Improved Trip

Combat Style Mastery (11th): Improved Critical

STRONG-ARM STYLE
The ranger using the strong-arm style wades into battle wielding the largest weapon she can. She relies on strength and the weight of steel to break through her opponent''s defenses. Feats such as Great Fortitude, Toughness, and those from the Power Attack feat tree augment this combat style. Many rangers who utilize this style come from nomadic tribal cultures.

Combat Style (2nd): Power Attack

Improved Combat Style (6th): Improved Sunder

Combat Style Mastery (11th): Great Cleave

THROWING STYLE
The bow isn''t the only ranged weapon favored by rangers; halflings have developed their own ranged combat style that employs their favorite ranged weapons - those they can throw. This style has found favor with some nomadic humans and barbaric humanoids. Like the archery style, practitioners of the throwing style try to maintain distance from opponents. Most take additional feats from the Point Blank Shot feat tree. Clever rangers also use this style to toss holy water vials at undead, acid vials and alchemist''s fire at trolls, and tanglefoot bags at those they wish to capture.

Combat Style (2nd): Quick Draw

Improved Combat Style (6th): Point Blank Shot

Combat Style Mastery (11th): Far Shot

Crowd-Walker
Certain individuals are comfortable among the throngs of citizens in even the most densely packed city. They know how to maneuver deftly through such environs without impediment.

Class: Druid or ranger.

Level: 2nd (druid) or 7th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain woodland stride.

Benefit: When moving through a crowd, the crowd-walker moves at her normal rate, rather than requiring two squares of movement for every square as is normal. In addition, light debris does not impede her movement, and she treats heavy debris as light debris. Any other sort of rough terrain impedes her normally, however.

Dead Levels
The ranger has five dead levels, the first of which occurs at 12th level. Their favored enemy bonuses follow a logical progression (one every five levels) if you imagine the 1st favored enemy ability to be granted during a conceptual "0" level for apprentices. Rangers consistently gain new spells per day during all of their dead levels, and so their dead level abilities augment the minor aspects of what rangers are already good at doing.

Woodland Hunter (Ex): At 12th level, a ranger can make "get along in the wild" checks while moving at his full overland speed. See Survival.

Perceptive Tracker (Ex): At 14th level, a ranger never takes longer than a full-round action to find tracks with a Survival check. A second roll is still required to follow any discovered tracks.

Seasoned Explorer (Ex): At 16th level, a ranger can make Survival checks to gain a bonus on Fortitude saves against severe weather while moving at his full overland speed. See Survival.

Instinctive Tracker (Ex): At 18th level, a ranger takes a standard action to find tracks with a Survival check, allowing the character to simultaneously move at his speed.

Survivalist (Ex): At 19th level, the ranger becomes so certain in the use of Survival that the character can use it reliably even under adverse conditions. When making a skill check with Survival, the ranger may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent the character from doing so.


Distracting Attack
A ranger''s animal companion isn''t nearly as tough as a druid''s, and thus works best as a scout or occasional flanker in combat. If your ranger would prefer to avoid the hassle of taking care of an animal companion, you can get some of the same benefit with the distracting attack alternative class feature. Though not as effective as an actual flanker, the ability to spread out your attacks to affect multiple enemies is a nice side effect.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain an animal companion.

Benefit: Beginning at 4th level, whenever you hit an enemy with a weapon attack (whether melee or ranged), that enemy is considered flanked by you for the purpose of adjudicating your allies'' attacks. For example, if your rogue ally attacked that enemy, not only would she gain a +2 bonus on her melee attack roll but she could also add her sneak attack damage to a successful melee attack.

This flanked condition lasts until either the enemy is attacked by one of your allies or until the start of your next turn, whichever comes first. This is an extraordinary ability.

This ability has no effect on creatures that can''t be flanked.

Elf Ranger
The elf ranger combines sylvan grace with deadly skill, moving effortlessly through the wilds in search of his prey. He isn''t quite as tough as a typical ranger but enjoys extra bonuses against his race''s favored enemies and can befriend a powerful elven hound.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take an elf ranger substitution level, a character must be an elf about to take his 1st, 4th, or 10th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Elf ranger substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard ranger class, plus Balance.

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Elf Ranger Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+2	+0	Elf favored enemy, Track, wild empathy	—
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Elven hound companion	Same as ranger
10th	+10/+5	+7	+7	+3	Strongheart slayer	Same as ranger
Class Features
All the following are features of the elf ranger''s racial substitution levels.

Elf Favored Enemy (Ex): An elf ranger''s favored enemy ability grants him a +2 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks used against creatures of the chosen type, and a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. If the elf ranger chooses humanoid (orc), undead, or "servants of Lolth" as his favored enemy, these bonuses rise to +3. "Servants of Lolth" includes drow, monstrous spiders of all sizes, and driders; this is an addition to the normal list of options for a ranger''s favored enemy.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger''s 1st-level favored enemy class feature.

This substitution feature also affects the elf ranger''s later improvements to his favored enemy ability. Each time an elf ranger gains a new favored enemy, he can increase the bonus for one favored enemy by 2, or by 3 if he chooses to increase his bonus against orcs, undead, or the servants of Lolth.

Elven Hound Companion (Ex): A 4th-level elf ranger can select an elven hound as his animal companion, even though the creature is a magical beast. For the purpose of any of the ranger''s spells that affect animals, as well as his use of Handle Animal or wild empathy on the companion, the elven hound is treated as an animal.

Strongheart Slayer (Ex): A 10th-level elf ranger gains a +4 morale bonus on Will saves against the spells and spell-like abilities of drow and driders, and a +4 morale bonus on Fortitude saves against the poison of monstrous spiders.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger''s 10th-level third favored enemy class feature, as well as the additional +2 (or +3) bonus against an existing favored enemy. The elf ranger instead gains his third favored enemy at 15th level.


Fangshields Ranger
Rangers of the Fangshields use their skills to patrol the wildlands, as well as to spy on and hunt evil creatures. However, some of the standard ranger class features are useless to creatures that lack hands to use manufactured weapons. Fangshields rangers learn other abilities to take advantage of their nonhumanoid anatomy, helping them become dangerous leaders of beasts and animals.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Fangshields ranger substitution level, a character must be a nonhumanoid creature, be a member of the Fangshields, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 2nd, 4th, or 5th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Fangshields ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus Diplomacy.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the Fangshields ranger substitution levels.

Combat Style (Ex): Often lacking hands, Fangshields rangers have a third option for their combat style: natural attacks. If a ranger selects this combat style, at 2nd level he gains Multiattack (if he has more than one kind of natural attack) or Improved Natural Attack (if he has only one kind of natural attack) as a bonus feat.

At 6th level, a ranger with this combat style gains Weapon Focus for any one of his natural attack types. At 11th level, a ranger with this combat option gains Weapon Focus for a second of his natural weapons, or Greater Weapon Focus for his natural weapon if he has only one kind.

A Fangshields ranger need not meet any of the normal prerequisites for these bonus feats.

Animal Companion (Ex): A Fangshields ranger uses the normal ranger animal companion rules, but because he is beastlike himself, he has a stronger bond with the animal. The ranger''s effective druid level is treated as one-half his ranger level +2.

Lion and the Unicorn (Ex): At 5th level, a Fangshields ranger chooses an affinity for Nobanion or Lurue, even if he already has a patron deity (this doesn''t cause a religious conflict). If he chooses Nobanion, he gets a +1 sacred bonus to AC during the day; if he chooses Lurue, he gets a +1 sacred bonus to AC during the night. He gets the benefit of this ability whether or not he is outside or knows the time of day. This ability doesn''t apply on a plane other than the Material Plane.

This benefit replaces the second favored enemy class feature gained by a standard ranger at 5th level.


Table: Fangshields Ranger Substitution Levels

Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
2nd	+2	+3	+3	+0	Combat style	—
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Animal companion	Same as ranger
5th	+5	+4	+4	+1	Lion and the Unicorn	Same as ranger

Favored Environment
Instead of selecting a type of creature against which to apply a bonus on certain skills and damage rolls, the ranger selects a specific natural environment and gains bonuses when in that environment.

At 1st level, a ranger may select a natural environment from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Environments. Due to the ranger''s experience in that environment, he gains a +2 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills in that environment. He also gains the same bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks made in association with that environment (or on Knowledge (dungeoneering) checks made in association with underground environments, if the ranger has selected underground as a favored environment).

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (at 10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored environment from those given on the table and gains an identical bonus on the appropriate skill checks in that environment. In addition, at each such interval, the bonuses in any one favored environment (including the one just selected, if so desired) increase by 2. For example, a 5th-level ranger has two favored environments. In one he has a +4 bonus on the appropriate skill checks, and in the other he has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, he has three favored environments, and he gains an additional +2 bonus, which he can allocate to any of his three favored environments. Thus, his bonuses could be either +4, +4, and +2 or +6,+2, and +2.

If the ranger chooses desert or forest, he must also choose a climate type, as indicated on the table (either "cold" or "temperate or warm" for desert, or "cold or temperate" or "warm" for forest).

The game master may rule that a ranger can''t select an environment that he has never visited.

Table: Ranger Favored Environments

Environment	Examples
Aquatic	Sea, ocean (on or under water)
Desert, cold	Tundra
Desert, temperate or warm	Badlands, sandy desert
Forest, cold or temperate	Forest
Forest warm	Jungle
Hills	Rugged terrain up to 2,000 feet elevation
Marsh	Bog, moor, swamp
Mountain	Rugged terrain above 2,000 feet elevation
Plains	Farmland, grassland, steppe, prairie
Underground	Dungeons, caverns
Feign Death
A clever villain has many contingencies in place, so that if a plan goes awry, he can beat a hasty retreat. In exchange for some ability to evade damage, he can enter a state that is indistinguishable from death.

Class: Monk, ranger, or rogue.

Level: 2nd (monk or rogue) or 9th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability. If your class would grant you improved evasion at a higher level, you instead gain evasion.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can enter a catatonic state in which you appear to be dead. While feigning death, you cannot see or feel anything, but you retain the ability to smell, hear, and otherwise follow what is going on around you.

While under the effect of this ability, you are immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, ability drain, negative levels, and death effects. Attempts to resuscitate you, such as raise dead or reincarnation, automatically fail, though resurrection and true resurrection immediately end your feign death ability.

Spells and other effects that assess your current condition, such as status and deathwatch, indicate that you are dead. However, a character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) can discern that you are actually alive.

You can remain in the catatonic state indefinitely, though you still require food, water, and air. Emerging from feigned death is a standard action.

Gnome Ranger
Hampered to some extent by her size, the gnome ranger learns to play off her other strengths. By embracing her connection to burrowing animals, the gnome ranger can attract an animal companion that can support her in combat. Against her favored enemies, she favors tactics of stealth more than interaction, and she truly shines when she chooses the traditional foes of her race as favored enemies. Her magic likewise draws on her racial abilities, allowing her to cast illusions unavailable to most rangers. The combination of these abilities makes the gnome ranger a fearsome ambusher who fights with the ferocity of the badger.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a gnome ranger substitution level, a character must be a gnome about to take her 1st, 4th, or 8th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Gnome ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Gnome Ranger Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+2	+0	Gnome favored enemy, Track, wild empathy	—
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Burrowing animal companion	Same as ranger
8th	+8/+3	+6	+6	+2	Gnome ranger spells	Same as ranger
Class Features
All the following are features of the gnome ranger''s racial substitution levels.

Gnome Favored Enemy (Ex): A gnome ranger who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level may select a type of creature from among those given on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. Due to her extensive study of her chosen type of foe and training in the proper techniques for combating such creatures, she gains a +2 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against creatures of this type. Likewise, she gets a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against such creatures. If the gnome ranger chooses humanoid (goblinoid), humanoid (reptilian), or giant as her favored enemy, both bonuses rise to +3.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional favored enemy from those given on the table. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one favored enemy (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2. For example a 5th-level gnome ranger has two favored enemies; against one she gains a +4 bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls, and against the other she has a +2 bonus. At 10th level, she has three favored enemies, and she gains an additional +2 bonus, which she can allocate to the bonus against any one of her three favored enemies. Thus her bonuses could be either +4, +4, +2 or +6, +2, +2. If the gnome ranger selected humanoid (goblinoid), humanoid (reptilian), or giant as one of her favored enemies, the bonus on Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival checks and weapon damage rolls increases by 3 instead of 2.

If the ranger chooses humanoids or outsiders as a favored enemy, she must also choose an associated subtype, as indicated on Table: Ranger Favored Enemies. If a specific creature falls into more than one category of favored enemy (for instance, devils are both evil outsiders and lawful outsiders), the ranger''s bonuses do not stack; she simply uses whichever bonus is higher.

This benefit replaces the standard ranger''s 1st-level favored enemy class feature.

Burrowing Animal Companion (Ex): If a gnome ranger takes the 4th-level racial substitution level and chooses a badger, dire badger, or wolverine as her animal companion (or any other mammalian animal with a burrowing speed), her effective druid level equals 1/2 her ranger level +3, instead of 1/2 her ranger level. (If she chooses a dire badger or a wolverine, her effective druid level is still reduced by 3, per the Alternative Animal Companions table.) In addition, she can use her racial speak with animals ability to speak with her animal companion at will.

This benefit replaces the standard ranger''s ability to share spells with her animal companion.
Gnome Ranger Spells: A gnome ranger who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level adds blur, invisibility, and misdirection to the list of 2nd-level ranger spells she can prepare and cast. These spells replace barkskin, snare, and wind wall on the ranger spell list.

Although she cannot cast them yet, she also adds greater invisibility and phantasmal killer to her list of 4th-level ranger spells. These spells replace commune with nature and tree stride on the ranger spell list.

Golarion Ranger
Rangers who join a military unit sometimes focus their training on a single animal, to the exclusion of all others, forming a tight bond. This ability replaces the wild empathy ability.

Enhanced Companion (Ex): Upon gaining an animal companion at 4th level, the ranger must choose a single type of animal. The ranger cannot call a different animal companion. The ranger''s effective druid level is equal to the ranger''s level -2 (instead of the normal 1/2) for that type of animal. This animal must be on the basic list of companions that can be chosen at 4th level and cannot be changed.


Half-Elf Ranger
Not all rangers spend their entire lives in the untamed wilds of the forests and hills. Some half-elves find a mix of rural and urban life to their taste, and temper their wilderness lore with the ability to interact well with a wide range of individuals. The half-elf ranger is the ultimate investigator and bounty hunter. She finds social skills just as important for survival as fighting prowess.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a half-elf ranger substitution level, a character must be a half-elf about to take her 1st, 4th, or 13th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Half-elf ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class, plus Gather Information and Speak Language.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the half-elf ranger racial substitution levels.

Urban Tracking (Ex): The half-elf ranger gains Urban Tracking as a bonus feat.

An 8th-level ranger with Urban Tracking can cut the time required per Gather Information check to 30 minutes without taking the normal -5 penalty on the check. (This benefit augments, but does not replace, the standard 8thlevel ranger class feature of swift tracker.)

This benefit replaces the Track feat normally gained as a bonus feat by a standard 1st-level ranger.

Street Magic: At 4th level, a half-elf ranger adds the following spells to her class spell list: 1st - comprehend languages, detect secret doors, message; 2nd - detect thoughts, tongues; 3rd - phantom steed; 4th - dimension door.

A ranger who selects this substitution feature loses the following spells from her class spell list: 1st - detect animals or plants, detect snares and pits, entangle, summon nature''s ally I; 2nd - snare, speak with plants, summon nature''s ally II; 3rd - command plants, diminish plants, plant growth, summon nature''s ally II, tree shape; 4th - commune with nature, summon nature''s ally IV, tree stride.

Skill Mastery (Ex): At 13th level, a half-elf ranger becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so.

This benefit replaces the standard ranger''s camouflage ability.


Table: Half-Elf Ranger Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+2	+0	1st Favored enemy, Urban Tracking, wild empathy	—
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Animal companion, street magic	Same as ranger
13th	+13/+8/+3	+8	+8	+4	Skill mastery	Same as ranger

Hidden Stalker
For those who know how to use them, the ever-shifting concealment of the throng and the back alleys of the city provide just as much opportunity for stealth as the shadows of the trees or the early morning fog.

Class: Ranger or scout.

Level: 13th (ranger) or 8th (scout).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the camouflage ability, and your hide in plain sight ability (gained at higher levels) is modified.

Benefit: Upon first gaining this ability, the hidden stalker no longer takes a -5 penalty on Hide checks when moving faster than half speed, nor does she take the standard -10 penalty when attempting to hide during a brief distraction. In addition, the presence of other people within 5 feet is considered sufficient cover for her to hide, making it easy for her to vanish into a crowd.

At the second level of this ability, the hidden stalker gains hide in plain sight, but this ability functions in any urban environment, rather than only in natural environments as written.

Kobold Ranger
Kobold rangers are not deterred by their size, forging lifelong relationships with their preferred dire weasel companions, who more than make up for their masters'' physical shortcomings. A kobold ranger is a sentinel for her tribe, riding the fringes of her lands in search of enemies and threats. Nothing slows a kobold ranger in pursuit of prey.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a kobold ranger substitution level, a character must be a kobold about to take her 1st, 4th, or 7th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Kobold ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Kobold Ranger Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+2	+0	Kobold favored enemy, Track, wild empathy	—
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Dire weasel companion, kobold ranger spells	Same as ranger
7th	+7/+2	+5	+5	+2	Subterranean stride	Same as ranger
Class Features
All the following are class features of the kobold ranger racial substitution levels.

Kobold Favored Enemy (Ex): A kobold ranger who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains the normal ranger favored enemy bonus on checks and damage rolls, but the skills affected by the bonus are Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, and Survival instead of those given for the standard ranger.

If a kobold ranger selects fey, humanoid (dwarf), or humanoid (gnome) as her favored enemy, she gains a +3 bonus against the chosen creature type instead of the standard +2. Bonuses against such creatures also increase by 3 every time the kobold ranger gains a new favored enemy, instead of the standard +2 increase.

This substitution feature replaces but is otherwise identical to the standard ranger''s favored enemy class feature (PH 47).

Dire Weasel Companion (Ex): A kobold ranger who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains a dire weasel animal companion. This ability functions like the druid''s animal companion ability, treating the kobold ranger''s effective druid level as half her ranger level, instead of half her ranger level -3. A kobold ranger cannot select from an alternative list of animal companions; she is restricted to choosing a dire weasel as her animal companion.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger''s animal companion class feature.

Kobold Ranger Spells: A kobold ranger who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level replaces certain spells on her ranger spell list with kobold alternatives. For 1st-level ranger spells, steal size replaces entangle. A kobold ranger also exchanges the 2nd-level ranger spells speak with plants and spike growth for local tremor and soften earth and stone. She replaces the 3rd-level ranger spells command plants, diminish plants, plant growth, and tree shape with meld into stone, spike stones, stone shape, and stoneskin. Stone tell replaces the 4th-level ranger spell tree stride.

Subterranean Stride (Ex): A kobold ranger who takes the 7th-level racial substitution level can move across dense rubble or natural stone floors at her normal speed, ignoring any effects related to terrain (DMG 60). However, a rock surface that is enchanted or magically manipulated to impede motion still affects her.

This substitution feature replaces the standard ranger''s woodland stride class feature.

Moon-Warded Ranger
Moon-warded rangers call upon the essence of the moon to defend themselves. By forgoing attack capabilities normally afforded by the ranger class, the moon-warded ranger gains access to special defensive bonuses. This variant ranger gains all the class features of the standard ranger, except as noted.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a moon-warded ranger substitution level, a character must worship the moon and be about to take her 2nd, 6th, or 11th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Moon-warded ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.

6th	+6/+1	+5	+5	+2	Skin of the moon	Same as ranger
11th	+11/+6/+1	+7	+7	+3	Indomitable mind	Same as ranger
Class Features
All of the following are features of the moon-warded ranger''s substitution levels.

Armor of the Senses (Su): At 2nd level, a moon-warded ranger adds her Wisdom bonus (if any) to her AC. This bonus only applies when the ranger wears light armor or no armor. This bonus to AC applies even against touch attacks and when the ranger is flat-footed. She loses this bonus when she is immobilized or helpless, when she wears any armor greater than light, or when she carries a medium or heavy load.

This ability replaces the standard ranger''s combat style ability.

Skin of the Moon (Su): At 6th level, a moon-warded ranger gains damage reduction 2/- at night, regardless of whether or not the moon is visible. This damage reduction increases to 3/- under the unobscurred light of the moon. This ability stacks with damage reduction of the same type from other sources (such as a barbarian''s DR).

This ability replaces the standard ranger''s improved combat style ability.

Indomitable Mind (Su): At 11th level, a moon-warded ranger gains immunity to mind-affecting spells and abilities, with the exception of harmless mind-affecting spells and abilities (such as bless and heroism).

This ability replaces the standard ranger''s combat style mastery ability.

Mystic Ranger
Mystic rangers combine fighting prowess, wilderness survival skills, and magical abilities - like standard rangers. However, a mystic ranger spends more time in prayer and meditation, and is well attuned to the spiritual side of his discipline. Hence, this form of ranger gains spell abilities much sooner, and is able to wield them more effectively than the standard ranger class. In consequence their more combat-oriented abilities are weaker and are learned later.

The mystic ranger is a variant ranger. Unless otherwise noted, a mystic ranger advances in the same manner as a ranger (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of ranger or mystic ranger, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level ranger twice.

Class Features
The mystic ranger gains Endurance and his combat style abilities later than the ranger, and gives up the ability to gain an animal companion.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: A mystic ranger is proficient with all simple weapons, martial ranged weapons, and light armor. A mystic ranger is not proficient with martial melee weapons or shields.

Spell List: The mystic ranger casts 1st-through 4th-level spells from the ranger spell list. His 0-level spell list consists of create water, cure minor wounds, flare, guidance, know direction, light, mending, purify food and drink, resistance, and virtue. His 5th-level list consists of awaken, baleful polymorph, cure critical wounds, control winds, summon nature''s ally V, and wall of thorns.

Natural Born Ranger
Culture often exerts as strong a pull upon young people as their lineage. Acquiring likes, loathings, special talents, and important insights at their parent''s knee, a body of lore comes to them almost as a birthright. A few, however, follow their own unique paths. They take other ways, scorning the lessons so eagerly sought by their playmates in favor of what they teach themselves. These atypical members of the different races usually band together. Although too rare or new to be true subraces, it is groups such as these that eventually interbreed and develop into their own subsets of the common races. All of the racial traits presented here focus on characters who begin play at 1st level as rangers, so these alternative racial traits might not work well in a world where the standard races already have "wild" subraces. Given a few generations, however, those with these new racial traits might easily interbreed to such an extent that they form wild subraces.

These new racial traits require a character to begin play as a ranger and to give up one or more standard racial traits. As elves and half-orcs lack (or have very few) racial traits based on their cultures, they gain compensating drawbacks instead of losing traits they already have.

Because these alternative rules fundamentally alter the way races work, a DM is encouraged to have a careful and thorough understanding of these racial traits before allowing them in her campaign.

Dwarf Ranger
The forge. The chisel. They held little appeal. When others talked of battles with giants you paid scant attention, already hatching strategies to help you face what you saw as the true threat.

These dwarf rangers lose stonecunning, their bonuses on Appraise and Craft checks, and their dodge bonus to AC against giants. In exchange, they gain a dodge bonus to AC against their favored enemies equal to half their bonuses on damage and skill checks. For instance, a dwarf ranger who has a +4 favored enemy bonus against aberrations gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC whenever he faces an aberration.

Elf Ranger
Even as a child you knew that your homeland was a marvelous, special place, its inhabitants blessed by the deities and deserving of your protection. Nothing drives you to greater passion than coming face to face with interlopers bent upon despoiling it.

These elven rangers gain a particular affinity for the terrain of their homelands. Choose a terrain: aquatic, desert, forest, hills, marsh, mountain, or plains. The elf ranger gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls made while in that terrain. Outside of that terrain, however, the elf ranger''s unfamiliarity imposes a -1 penalty on Wisdom- and Intelligence-based skill checks.

Gnome Ranger
The others laughed and played their pranks, but you always took life more seriously. Life was dangerous, dirty, and hard, and as your innate magic developed you discovered more sensible uses than practical jokes.

These gnome rangers retain their ability to cast speak with animals but lose their other spell-like abilities in order to cast create water, detect poison and purify food and drink once per day. Caster level 1st; save DC 10 + gnome''s Charisma modifier + spell level.

Half-Elf Ranger
Strangers made you uncomfortable, always staring and asking rude questions. You kept your distance. Eventually you learned to find refuge in the wilds and fellowship with the creatures that lived there.

These half-elf rangers lose their +2 bonus on Diplomacy and Gather Information checks, gaining in exchange a +2 bonus on Handle Animal and Hide checks.

Half-Orc Ranger
Outcast! Outsider! Your blood is tainted, surviving only on hatred and raw determination, you renounced half of your background and vowed bloody vengeance.

These half-orc rangers gain a particular hatred and disdain for one side of their heritage. A half-orc ranger may select an additional favored enemy at 1st level, choosing either humanoid (human) or humanoid (orc) and gaining a +2 bonus on damage rolls and certain skill checks as normal. The half-orc ranger cannot also select humanoid (human) or humanoid (orc) as his 1st-level favored enemy. As he advances in levels he may increase this bonus like any other favored enemy. However, his instinctive loathing and revulsion for this part of his parentage imposes a penalty on all Charisma checks and skills equal to his favored enemy bonus when dealing with members of the race he despises.

Halfling Ranger
The others trusted in fate, secure in their beliefs that their deities would protect them from harm. You knew too much about the evils that surrounded you to rely upon faith and devoted yourself to preparing for the battles to come.

These halfling rangers lose their +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. In exchange, they gain a bonus on saving throws and opposed skill checks versus their favored enemies equal to half their bonus on damage and skill checks made against these enemies.

Phynxkin Companion
A druid or ranger who adventures in regions rich with draconic influence can gain an alternative animal companion, a phynxkin, that serves him as loyally as any other animal companion would.

Class: Druid or ranger.

Level: 1st (druid) or 4th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you give up your standard choice of animal companion, and your animal companion does not gain all benefits normally accorded to it (see below).

Benefit: You gain a phynxkin as an animal companion. Treat it as an animal for the purpose of determining the effects of your skills, feats, spells, and other abilities.

When your phynxkin would normally gain the devotion special quality, both you and the phynxkin instead gain immunity to fear effects, but only while you are within 30 feet of each other.

When your effective druid level for determining your animal companion''s abilities reaches 7th, you can replace your animal companion with a dire phynxkin animal companion. Doing this reduces your effective druid level for determining its abilities by six.

Planar Ranger
Rangers from the Material Plane stalk and protect forests and hills, and the same is true for rangers who live on other planes. Of course, they may be crystal forests and hills of flame, but the deep personal connection and dedication remain exactly the same.

Whatever the nature of a planar ranger''s chosen home, he is as comfortable there as a noble is upon his throne. He can sense trouble on the wind, glean details of recent events from a single footprint, and know the habits of the local f lora and fauna the way a mother bear knows her cubs.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a ranger planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 4th, 8th, or 13th level of ranger.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Ranger planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.


Table: Ranger Planar Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Planar animal companion	Same as ranger
8th	+8/+3	+6	+6	+2	Portal intuition	Same as ranger
13th	+13/+8/+3	+8	+8	+4	Planar tracking	Same as ranger
Class Features
All of the following are features of the ranger''s planar substitution levels.

Planar Animal Companion (Ex): At 4th level, a planar ranger can select a celestial or fiendish animal as his animal companion. Doing this reduces the ranger''s effective druid level by one.

For example, a 4th-level planar ranger (with an effective druid level of 1st) can select an animal from the normal list of potential companions. When he reaches 8th level, that companion would gain the bonus Hit Dice and other special abilities granted to the animal companion of a 3rd-level druid. He can''t select a celestial leopard or fiendish wolverine until he reaches 10th level (effective druid level 4th).

Unlike a typical animal companion, the planar animal companion is a magical beast. However, the ranger (and only the ranger) can still affect it with his spells as if it were an animal.

To gain a celestial companion, a ranger must have a nonevil alignment. To gain a fiendish companion, a ranger must have a nongood alignment. If the ranger''s alignment changes to one that is ineligible for the companion, the companion either turns on the ranger or leaves at its earliest convenience, depending on its natural tendencies.

Portal Intuition (Ex): At 8th level, a planar ranger becomes an expert at tracking quarry across planes and through various portals and breaches. When examining a portal, the ranger may attempt to determine to which plane the portal leads. To do this, he must succeed on both a DC 20 Survival check and a DC 20 Knowledge (the planes) check.

The ranger can also use this ability to determine whether or not a planar breach occurred within 20 feet of a particular spot within the last 24 hours. To do this, he must succeed on a DC 20 Search check. If the ranger determines that a breach did occur in the area, he may then use this ability to ascertain where it led.

This benefit replaces the swift tracker class feature gained by a standard ranger at 8th level.

Planar Tracking (Sp): Once per day, a ranger who chooses this substitution benefit can use plane shift as a spell-like ability (with a caster level equal to his class level) in order to follow his quarry. He must be tracking a favored enemy, and he must be at the spot where the creature traveled from one plane to another.

Unlike with the plane shift spell, the ranger has no chance of deviation from the intended destination. He and anyone he brings with him arrives in the exact spot that his quarry did. Spells that prevent planar travel (such as dimensional lock) affect this ability as they would any casting of plane shift.

The ranger does not automatically pick up his quarry''s trail when he arrives on the new plane. He must use his Track feat to find the creature''s tracks and pick up the hunt. But he has the advantage of knowing that his target definitely passed that way.

This benefit replaces the camouflage class feature gained by a standard ranger at 13th level.

Planewalker Ranger
The planewalker ranger roams the multiverse instead of the wilderness, learning the secrets of the planes.

Class Skills
Eliminate Knowledge (nature) and Knowledge (dungeoneering) from the ranger''s class skill list.

Add Knowledge (the planes) and Speak Language (Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Celestial, Ignan, Infernal, Terran only) to the class skill list.

Class Features
The planewalker ranger has all the standard ranger class features, except as noted below.
Wild Empathy: A planewalker ranger takes no penalty on wild empathy checks made to influence magical beasts with the celestial or fiendish templates. However, he takes a -4 penalty when using this ability against animals.

Animal Companion: A nonevil planewalker ranger may have a celestial version of a normal animal as his animal companion. A nongood planewalker ranger may have a fiendish version of a normal animal as his animal companion.

Spellcasting: A planewalker ranger''s spellcasting ability is largely unchanged from that of the standard ranger, with one exception: Any ranger spell that normally affects animals also affects celestial or fiendish versions of animals when cast by a planewalker ranger.

Predator
A ranger might forgo training in weapon combat in exchange for the ability to take animal form and move swiftly through the woodlands.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Combat style, improved combat style, combat style mastery.

Gain: Wild shape (as druid; Small or Medium animals only), fast movement (as barbarian).

Rival Organization
A few urban rangers, devoted to a particular organization, guild, or church, prefer to focus their studies and their efforts against a rival group, instead of a specific race.

Class: Ranger.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain favored enemy or any later improvements to that class feature.

Benefit: At 1st level, the ranger chooses one particular organization that he has studied in depth. This could be a guild, a noble house, a church, or any similar specifically defined entity. (See Politics and Power for definitions and samples of these groups.) Due to his knowledge of how the organization operates, he gains a +2 bonus on Bluff, Intimidate, Gather Information, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive checks made against, or pertaining to, members of that organization. Likewise, due to his heightened awareness around these individuals, he gains a +2 bonus to Armor Class against members of this group.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter (10th, 15th, and 20th level), the ranger may select an additional rival organization. In addition, at each such interval, the bonus against any one rival organization (including the one just selected, if so desired) increases by 2.

Shadow Sword
Rangers of the Knights of the Shadow Sword patrol Myth Drannor and attempt to rid it of the evils living there. They use their stealth and spell-power to aid the fighters of their order.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Shadow Sword substitution level, a character must have Shaundakul as his patron, be a member of the Knights of the Shadow Sword, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 3rd, 6th, or 8th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Shadow Sword substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus Knowledge (history).

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.


Table: Shadow Sword Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
3rd	+3	+3	+3	+1	Walk in silence	—
6th	+6/+1	+5	+5	+2	Bane weapon	Same as ranger
8th	+8/+3	+6	+6	+2	Portal analysis	Same as ranger
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Shadow Sword substitution levels.

Walk in Silence (Su): At 3rd level, a Shadow Sword gains the ability to move with amazing silence, receiving a +5 circumstance bonus on Move Silently checks for 1 round. The ranger activates this ability with a swift action and can use it a number of times per day equal to one-half his ranger level. This ability only functions if the ranger is wearing light or no armor and carrying no more than a light load.

This benefit replaces the Endurance bonus feat gained by a standard ranger at 3rd level.

Bane Weapon (Su): At 6th level, a Shadow Sword learns how to temporarily turn any weapon he wields into a bane weapon. Activating this ability requires a full-round action, at which point the ranger must choose the type (and subtype, if appropriate) of creature against which the bane special ability will apply. This choice must match a creature type (and subtype) of one of the ranger''s favored enemies. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to one-half the ranger''s class level, and can be used a number of times per day equal to one + his Wisdom modifier (minimum 1/day). The bane ability only functions while the weapon is in the ranger''s hands. The ranger can have no more than one weapon affected by this class feature at any time, nor can any weapon benefit from more than one application of this class feature (in either case, a second use immediately ends any previous effect).

This benefit replaces the improved combat style class feature normally gained at 6th level. If a Shadow Sword ranger later gains combat style mastery, he instead gains improved combat style.

Portal Analysis (Su): At 8th level, a Shadow Sword gains the ability to sense portals and manipulate them in strange ways. He automatically detects any portal within 10 feet and can thereafter study any portal within 10 feet as if using analyze portal. If he is able to activate the portal, once per day the Shadow Sword can enter it as if using the portal well spell.

This benefit replaces the swift tracker class feature gained by a standard ranger at 8th level.

Shifter Ranger
Many shifters become rangers, both from their love of the ranger''s solitude and single-minded purpose, and from their inherent connection to the natural world. Racial substitution levels allow the shifter ranger to enjoy an even stronger bond with the wilderness, enhancing his own shifting abilities and even sharing them with his animal companion.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a shifter ranger substitution level, a character must be a shifter about to take his 1st, 4th, or 9th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Shifter ranger substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class, plus Balance.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Shifter Ranger Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+1	+2	+2	+0	1st favored enemy, Track, wild empathy	—
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Animal companion, share shifting	Same as ranger
9th	+9/+4	+6	+6	+3	Enhanced shifting	Same as ranger
Class Features
All the following are features of the shifter ranger''s racial substitution levels.

Wild Empathy (Ex): Beginning at 1st level, a shifter ranger can improve the attitude of an animal. This ability functions identically to the druid class feature of the same name, except that the shifter ranger''s innate understanding of the natural world allows him to add his Wisdom modifier (instead of his Charisma modifier) to his wild empathy checks.

Share Shifting (Su): A shifter ranger of 4th level or higher can share the benefits he gains while shifting with his animal companion. The companion must be adjacent to the ranger when he begins shifting (though any distance between them has no subsequent effect). All shared benefits end when the ranger''s shifting ends (or if he loses consciousness).

The animal companion gains all the benefits of shifting (including any shifter feats or class features in effect for the shifter ranger), though it does not gain any new natural weapons. If it already has a natural weapon that the shifter ranger gains while shifting, it gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls for every four of the ranger''s class levels.

This substitution feature replaces a standard ranger''s ability to share spells with his animal companion.

Enhanced Shifting (Su): A 9th-level shifter ranger gains an extra benefit while shifting, based on his primary shifter trait (the trait chosen during character creation, and the one that provides a bonus to his ability score).

If the shifter''s primary trait grants a bonus to Strength, the shifter''s natural weapons are treated as adamantine for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction while shifting. This benefit applies to the gorebrute, longtooth, and razorclaw traits.

If the shifter''s primary trait grants a bonus to Dexterity, the shifter gains improved evasion, avoiding damage from certain attacks with a successful Reflex save and taking only half damage on a failed save (see the monk class feature). This benefit applies to the cliffwalk, longstride, and swiftwing traits.

If the shifter''s primary trait grants a bonus to Constitution, the shifter gains fast healing while shifting, gaining a number of hit points per round equal to 1 + the number of shifter feats he possesses. See Fast Healing for details, but note that this ability doesn''t stack with any other fast healing the shifter might possess. This benefit applies to the beasthide, truedive, and wildhunt traits.

If the shifter''s primary trait grants a bonus to Wisdom, the shifter gains immunity to enchantment effects while shifting. This benefit applies to the dreamsight trait.

This substitution feature replaces a standard ranger''s evasion ability.

Shooting Star
Rangers of the Order of the Shooting Star (see Knights of the Mystic Fire) serve Mystra by scouting, spying, and dealing with fiends and monstrosities created by magical experimentation.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a Shooting Star substitution level, a character must have Mystra as her patron deity, be a member of the Order of the Shooting Star, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take her 3rd, 4th, or 8th level of ranger.

Class Skills
Shooting Star substitution levels have the class skills of the standard ranger class plus Knowledge (arcana) and Spellcraft.

Skill Points at Each Level: 6 + Int modifier.


Table: Shooting Star Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
3rd	+3	+3	+3	+1	Weavespeak	—
4th	+4	+4	+4	+1	Bonus spells, improved spellcasting	Same as ranger
8th	+8/+3	+6	+6	+2	Bonus spells, expanded spell list	Same as ranger
11th	+11/+6/+1	+7	+7	+3	Bonus spells, combat style mastery	Same as ranger
14th	+14/+9/+4	+9	+9	+4	Bonus spells	Same as ranger
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Shooting Star ranger substitution levels.

Weavespeak (Sp): Because the members of this order need to report their findings over long distances, starting at 3rd level a Shooting Star develops the power to use the Weave itself to transmit short messages. Once per day the character can transmit a message of twenty-five words or less to the nearest cleric, paladin, or ranger of Mystra (the Shooting Star can''t choose the recipient). This ability only functions where the Weave is active, and it cannot jump planar boundaries; the ranger knows if either condition would prevent the message from reaching its target. It is otherwise the equivalent of a sending spell.

This benefit replaces the Endurance bonus feat gained by a standard ranger at 3rd level.

Bonus Spells (Su): At 4th level, a Shooting Star gains a bonus 1st-level ranger spell slot as if from a high Wisdom score. At 8th level she gains a bonus 2nd-level ranger spell slot, at 11th level she gains a bonus 3rd-level ranger spell slot, and at 14th level she gains a bonus 4th-level ranger spell slot.

This benefit replaces the animal companion class feature gained by a standard ranger at 4th level.

Improved Spellcasting (Ex): When casting ranger spells, a Shooting Star can treat her caster level as equal to one-half her ranger level +2. If she also has arcane spellcasting ability from another class, she can add her caster level from that class to this value to determine her caster level.

Expanded Spell List: At 8th level, a Shooting Star adds see invisibility (2nd level) and word of recall (4th level) to her ranger spell list.

This replaces the standard ranger''s swift tracker class feature.

Skilled City-Dweller
The various wilderness-oriented skills are valuable indeed, but make less sense - and may prove less useful - for an urban character.

Class: Any class that has one or more of the "skills replaced," as listed below, on its list of class skills.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the "skills replaced" as listed below.

Benefit: The skilled city-dweller gains one or more skills as class skills, at the expense of other skills. If she does not have the proper skill to lose, she cannot gain the skill it grants as an urban benefit.

Note that she need not swap out all these skills. A skilled city-dweller may pick and choose, but she cannot later change her mind.

Skill Replaced	Skill Gained
Handle Animal	Gather Information
Knowledge (nature)	Knowledge (local)
Survival	Sense Motive
Ride	Tumble

Solitary Hunting
A ranger who loses his faith also loses his most obvious blessing of nature: his animal companion. In return, though, he becomes even more self-reliant.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain your animal companion. If you already have an animal companion. it abandons you immediately.

Benefit: Your favored enemy bonus also applies to your attack rolls.

Spell Reflection
Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator.

Class: Monk, ranger, rogue, or scout.

Level: 2nd (monk or rogue), 5th (scout), or 9th (ranger).

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain evasion. (If you would later gain improved evasion as a special ability, you gain evasion instead.)

Benefit: You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability.

For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a scorching ray, you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the scorching ray deals its normal damage to the wizard.

This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren''t subject to this reflection.

If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as scorching ray cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard''s scorching ray spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).

Spiritual Connection
You learn to speak with the spirits of the wild places. Although this ability does not automatically make such spirits well disposed toward you, it does provide several benefits.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the wild empathy class feature.

Benefit: You can use speak with animals and speak with plants, as the spells (caster level equals your ranger level). You can use any combination of these effects up to three times per day. These are spell-like abilities with caster level equal to your character level.

Spiritual Guide
You are befriended by a spiritual guide that speaks to you and aids you as long as you remain in the wilderness.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the animal companion class feature.

Benefit: You gain a spiritual guide. As long as you remain in natural surroundings (including underground caverns), this guide is a constant companion. Once you enter any civilized area larger than a hamlet, however, your spiritual guide leaves your side, returning only when you return to the wilds.

Although it cannot protect you from harm, your spiritual guide can warn you of impending danger. As long as your spiritual guide is with you, you gain a divine bonus equal to one-quarter your ranger level (rounded down) on Handle Animal, Knowledge (nature), Listen, Search, Spot, and Survival checks. In addition, you can use commune with nature, as the spell, once per day as a full round action (as a spell-like ability with caster level equals your ranger level). You can also prepare and cast this spell normally from your ranger spell list.


Trap Expert
Many rangers journey across the wild lands of the surface, but you are trained to descend deep into the earth.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain the Track feat at 1st level or the swift tracker ability at 8th level.

Benefit: You gain the trapfinding ability of the rogue. In addition, you gain Disable Device as a class skill. You can use the Search skill to locate traps with a DC higher than 20, and you can use Disable Device to bypass a trap or disarm magic traps.

Urban Companion
The fearsome animal companions who accompany some casters in the wild are indeed a boon in combat, but a hulking wolf or creeping tiger is out of place in an urban environment. Some characters believe that small and subtle is of greater value than massive and mighty.

Class: Druid or ranger.

Level: 1st (druid) or 4th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain an animal companion.

Benefit: The character gains the companionship of a smaller but far more intelligent creature than she otherwise would have. This is identical to the sorcerer''s ability to summon a familiar (PH 52), including all benefits granted and gained by the familiar, except as noted below. Her functional level for determining the abilities of the companion is equal to her druid level or one-half her ranger level.

She does not lose experience points if her urban companion is slain, and she requires only 24 hours to replace one who is lost.

Her urban companion has total hit points equal to 3/4 her own hit points, rather than half as per a familiar.

The urban companion gains the ability to speak with other animals of its kind when she has an effective master level of 1st, rather than 7th.

When she reaches an effective master level of 7th, she can speak with animals of her companion''s kind, as per speak with animals. This is a supernatural ability that functions constantly, and it requires only a free action to reactivate if somehow dispelled.

Urban Ranger
The urban ranger stalks the treacherous streets of the city, relying on his knowledge of alleyways and underworld contacts to keep him alive.

Class Skills
Eliminate Knowledge (nature), Knowledge (dungeoneering), and Survival from the ranger''s class skill list. Add Gather Information, Knowledge (local), and Sense Motive to the class skill list.

Class Features
The urban ranger has all the standard ranger class features, except as noted below.

Animal Companion: An urban ranger cannot have an animal larger than Medium as his animal companion.

Urban Tracking: An urban ranger does not gain the Track feat at 1st level. Instead, he gains the Urban Tracking feat (see below), which allows him to use Gather Information to track down a missing person, suspect, or other individual within a community.

Wild Empathy: An urban ranger adds only one-half his class level to wild empathy checks, reflecting his limited connection with the natural world.

Favored Enemy: At the game master''s discretion, an urban ranger may select an organization instead of a creature type as his favored enemy. For example, a character might select a particular thieves'' guild, merchant house, or even the city guard. The favored enemy bonuses would apply to all members of the chosen organization, regardless of their creature type or subtype.

Spellcasting: The urban ranger''s spell list is different from the standard ranger list. The following spells are eliminated from the urban ranger''s spell list: animal messenger, charm animal, detect animals or plants, speak with animals, bear''s endurance, hold animal, snare, speak with plants, command plants, diminish plants, plant growth, reduce animal, tree shape, water walk, commune with nature, and tree stride.

In exchange, the urban ranger adds the following spells to his class spell list:�

1st - comprehend languages, detect chaos/good/evil/law, detect secret doors, message;�

2nd - detect thoughts, eagle''s splendor, knock, locate object;�

3rd - discern lies, invisibility, speak with dead, tongues;�

4th - dimensional anchor, locate creature, mage''s faithful hound, true seeing.

Woodland Stride: An urban ranger does not gain this ability.

Swift Tracker (Ex): Beginning at 8th level, am urban ranger may make a Gather Information check for his Urban Tracking feat every half hour without taking the normal -5 penalty.

Camouflage: An urban ranger does not gain this ability.

Hide in Plain Sight (Ex): An urban ranger can use this ability in any area, whether natural terrain or not.


URBAN TRACKING [GENERAL]
You can track down the location of missing persons or wanted individuals within communities.

Benefit: To find the trail of an individual or to follow it for 1 hour requires a Gather Information check. You must make another Gather Information check every hour of the search, as well as each time the trail becomes difficult to follow, such as when it moves to a different area of town.

The DC of the check, and the number of checks required to track down your quarry, depends on the community size and the conditions:

Community Size	DC	Checks Required
Thorp, hamlet, or village	5	1d3
Small or large town	10	1d4+1
Small or large city	15	2d4
Metropolis	20	2d4+2

Conditions	DC Modifier
Every three creatures in the group being sought	-1
Every 24 hours party has been missing/sought	+1
Tracked party "lies low"	+5
Tracked party matches community''s
primary racial demographic	+2
Tracked party does not match community''s
primary, or secondary racial demographic	-2
If you fail a Gather Information check, you can retry after 1 hour of questioning. The game master should roll the number of checks required secretly, so that the player doesn''t know exactly how long the task will require.

Normal: A character without this feat can use Gather Information to find out information about a particular individual, but each check takes 1d4+1 hours and doesn''t allow effective trailing.

Special: A character with 5 ranks in Knowledge (local) gains a +2 bonus on the Gather Information check to use this feat.

You can cut the time between Gather Information checks in half (to 30 minutes per check rather than 1 hour), but you take a -5 penalty on the check.

Urban Tracker
Many rangers of the city learn to hunt people down through interrogation and questioning, since following tracks is often all but impossible on the busy streets.

Class: Ranger.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain Track as a bonus feat.

Benefit: He gains Urban Tracking as a bonus feat.

Voice of the City
For some, the ability to make oneself understood in the midst of any culture is of far greater value than the ability to influence the beasts of the wild.

Class: Druid, ranger, or spirit shaman.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain wild empathy.

Benefit: Through a combination of body language, tone, and expression, the voice of the city can make herself understood by those who do not speak her language, and she can interpret their meaning the same way. Simple concepts that can be conveyed in a few words (such as "Help!" or "Drop your weapon!") can be conveyed automatically. More complex concepts require her to make a roll: d20 + her class level + either her Wisdom modifier (if trying to understand someone else) or Charisma modifier (if trying to make someone else understand her). Roll each only once per conversation. If she fails, she cannot try to communicate with that specific individual via this ability until she has gained a level. (Thus, it is possible, if she succeeds in one roll but fails in the other, to hold a conversation where she can understand the other speaker but he cannot understand you, or vice-versa.)

The DC of the roll depends on creature type and how closely the individual''s language is related to any of her own. The ability works most effectively with other humanoids. In this case, if the individual''s language uses the same alphabet as any language she knows, the DC is 20. If it does not, the DC is 30. (See Speak Language for this information.)

The above DCs increase by 5 if the speaker is a fey, giant, or monstrous humanoid; they increase by 10 if the speaker is an elemental. If the other individual is of any other creature type, she cannot communicate via this ability.

If the speaker is deliberately trying to make himself understood, the voice of the city gains a +2 circumstance bonus on this roll. If she is attempting to interpret his speech from outside normal conversational distance (such as eavesdropping), she takes a -4 penalty on this roll.

In addition, she gains Speak Language as a class skill.

Warrior Ranger
The ranger is a hybrid class, in that he combines martial talents with spellcasting and other abilities. To make this class fit better into a warrior-focused campaign, consider using the following variant that trades the class'' spellcasting powers for other extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities. In general, this variant class gives up the versatility of daily spell selection in exchange for more powerful or reliable special abilities.

The variant ranger gains all the normal class features of the ranger, with the following changes and additions.

Spells: The ranger does not gain the ability to cast divine spells.

Fast Movement (Ex): At 6th level, the ranger''s base land speed increases by 10 feet. This benefit applies only when he is wearing no armor, light armor, or medium armor and not carrying a heavy load.

Nature''s Blessing (Su): At 11th level and higher, the ranger can use a standard action to add a +4 bonus to his Constitution, Dexterity, or Wisdom score. This ability may be used once per day, and its effect lasts for 1 minute per class level.

Healing Touch (Sp): Once per day, a ranger of 13th level or higher can use either neutralize poison or remove disease, as a caster whose level is equal to one-half the ranger''s class level.

Freedom of Movement (Sp): A ranger of 16th level or higher can use freedom of movement on himself once per day, as a caster whose level is equal to one-half the ranger''s class level.


Wasteland Ranger
Rangers of the waste are fierce protectors of their homeland. They are masters of desert camouf lage and have adapted weaponry and tactics that mimic those of creatures that share their environment. Desert nomads are most likely to produce rangers, with a wandering lifestyle that prepares them well for the role. This variant ranger gains all the normal class features of the ranger, with the changes below.

Heat Endurance: At 3rd level, a wasteland ranger gains Heat Endurance as a bonus feat. If he already has Heat Endurance, the ranger gains Improved Heat Endurance instead and need not meet the prerequisites for that feat. This benefit replaces the standard ranger''s Endurance bonus feat.

Sandskimmer: At 7th level, a wasteland ranger gains Sandskimmer as a bonus feat. This benefit replaces the standard ranger''s woodland stride class feature.

Waste Hunter (Ex): At 10th level, a wasteland ranger chooses a specific kind of favored enemy native to the waste from among the types or subtypes he has already chosen. (For example, he could choose dunewinders if he has magical beasts as a favored enemy.) He gains an additional +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls, and on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks against creatures of this kind. In addition, the ranger gains a +2 bonus on saves against the chosen creature''s special abilities and damage reduction 2/- against its physical attacks. This benefit replaces the new favored enemy gained at 10th level by a standard ranger, but the waste ranger''s bonuses against previously selected favored enemies increase as if he had gained a new favored enemy.

Wild Defender
The wild defender is a holy warrior attuned to the sacred divinity of nature. Druids usually welcome them, but most wild defenders work in solitude. The wild defender guards the land and those who use it respectfully. Those who violate the wilderness consider wild defenders a manifestation of nature''s wrath.

The wild defender is a variant ranger. Unless otherwise noted, a wild defender advances in the same manner as a ranger (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of ranger or wild defender, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level ranger twice.

Alignment: A wild defender must be neutral good, lawful neutral, neutral, or chaotic neutral.

Class Features
The wild defender loses the base ranger''s favored enemy, bonus feats, combat style, camouflage, and hide in plain sight class features but gains several druid and paladin abilities and acquires some class features at different levels than a ranger.

Smite Evil (Su): Once per day, the wild defender may attempt to smite evil with one normal melee attack. He adds his Charisma bonus (if any) to his attack roll and deals 1 extra point of damage per wild defender level. If the wild defender accidentally smites a creature that is not evil, the smite has no effect, but the ability is still used up for that day.

At 5th level and every five levels thereafter, the wild defender may smite enemies one additional time per day, as indicated on the Table: The Wild Defender. A character with levels in both wild defender and paladin adds his levels in both classes to determine how many times per day he may smite evil as well as the amount of extra damage he deals.

Natural Lore (Ex): The wild defender has a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and Survival checks.

Trackless Step (Ex): At 3rd level, the wild defender leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. He may choose to leave a trail if so desired.

Resist Nature''s Lure (Ex): At 4th level, the wild defender gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities of fey.

Rebuke Nature (Su): When the wild defender reaches 6th level, he gains the ability to rebuke (but not command) creatures of nature, just as an evil cleric can rebuke undead. He may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + his Charisma modifier. He rebukes nature as a cleric of three levels lower would turn undead. At 6th level, this ability only works on animals, but the wild defender gains control over a wider range of natural creatures as he gains levels.',

    description = 'Rogues share little in common with each other. Some are stealthy thieves. Others are silver-tongued tricksters. Still others are scouts, infiltrators, spies, diplomats, or thugs. What they share is versatility, adaptability, and resourcefulness. In general, rogues are skilled at getting what others don''t want them to get: entrance into a locked treasure vault, safe passage past a deadly trap, secret battle plans, a guard''s trust, or some random person''s pocket money.

Rogues adventure for the same reason they do most things: to get what they can get. Some are after loot; others want experience. Some crave fame; others seek infamy. Quite a few also enjoy a challenge. Figuring out how to thwart a trap or avoid an alarm is great fun for many rogues.

Rogues are highly skilled, and they can concentrate on developing any of several categories of skills. While not equal to members of many other classes in combat, a rogue knows how to hit where it hurts, and she can dish out a lot of damage with a sneak attack. Rogues have a sixth sense when it comes to avoiding danger. Experienced rogues develop mystical powers and skills as they master the arts of stealth, evasion, and sneak attacks. In addition, while not capable of casting spells on their own, rogues can "fake it" well enough to cast spells from scrolls, activate wands, and use just about any other magic item.

Rogues follow opportunity, not ideals. They are more likely to be chaotic than lawful, they are a diverse bunch, so they may be of any alignment.

Although they are not renowned for their piety, most rogues revere Olidammara (god of thieves). Evil rogues might secretly worship Nerull (god of death), or Erythnul (god of slaughter). Since rogues are so diverse, however, many of them worship other deities, or none at all.

Some rogues are officially inducted into an organized fellowship of rogues or "guild of thieves." Some are self taught; others learned their skills from independent mentors. Often, an experienced rogue needs an assistant for scams, second-story jobs, or just for watching her back. She recruits a likely youngster, who then learns the skills of the trade on the job. Eventually, the trainee is ready to move on, perhaps because the mentor has run afoul of the law, or perhaps because the trainee has double-crossed her mentor and needs some "space." Rogues do not see each other as fellows unless they happen to be members of the same guild or students of the same mentor. In fact, rogues trust other rogues less than they trust anyone else. They''re no fools.

Adaptable and often unprincipled, humans take to the rogue''s life with ease. Halflings, elves, and half-elves also find themselves well suited to the demands of the career. Dwarf and gnome rogues, while less common, are renowned as experts with locks and traps. Half-orc rogues tend toward thuggery. Rogues are common among brutal humanoids, especially goblins and bugbears. Rogues who learn their arts in savage lands, however, generally don''t have much experience with complex mechanisms such as traps and locks.

Rogues love and hate working with members of other classes. They excel when protected by warriors and supported by spellcasters. There are plenty of times, however, that they wish everyone else was as quiet, guileful, and patient as they. Rogues are particularly wary of paladins, so they endeavor to prove themselves useful when contact with paladins is unavoidable.

The rogue''s role in a group can vary dramatically based on her skill selection - from charismatic con artist to cunning burglar to agile combatant - but most rogues share certain aspects. They aren''t capable of prolonged melee combat, so they focus on opportunistic sneak attacks or ranged attacks. The rogue''s stealth and her trapfinding ability make her one of the best scouts in the game.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d6.

Class Skills
The rogue''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Appraise (Int), Balance (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Climb (Str), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Disable Device (Int), Disguise (Cha), Escape Artist (Dex), Forgery (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Hide (Dex), Intimidate (Cha), Jump (Str), Knowledge (local) (Int), Listen (Wis), Move Silently (Dex), Open Lock (Dex), Perform (Cha), Profession (Wis), Search (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Sleight of Hand (Dex), Spot (Wis), Swim (Str), Tumble (Dex), Use Magic Device (Cha), and Use Rope (Dex).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the rogue.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Rogues are proficient with all simple weapons, plus the hand crossbow, rapier, sap, shortbow, and short sword. Rogues are proficient with light armor, but not with shields.

Sneak Attack: If a rogue can catch an opponent when he is unable to defend himself effectively from her attack, she can strike a vital spot for extra damage. The rogue''s attack deals extra damage any time her target would be denied a Dexterity bonus to AC (whether the target actually has a Dexterity bonus or not), or when the rogue flanks her target. This extra damage is 1d6 at 1st level, and it increases by 1d6 every two rogue levels thereafter. Should the rogue score a critical hit with a sneak attack, this extra damage is not multiplied.

Ranged attacks can count as sneak attacks only if the target is within 30 feet.

With a sap (blackjack) or an unarmed strike, a rogue can make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage instead of lethal damage. She cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual -4 penalty.

A rogue can sneak attack only living creatures with discernible anatomies - undead, constructs, oozes, plants, and incorporeal creatures lack vital areas to attack. Any creature that is immune to critical hits is not vulnerable to sneak attacks. The rogue must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot. A rogue cannot sneak attack while striking a creature with concealment or striking the limbs of a creature whose vitals are beyond reach.

Trapfinding: Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Search skill to locate traps when the task has a Difficulty Class higher than 20. Finding a nonmagical trap has a DC of at least 20, or higher if it is well hidden. Finding a magic trap has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

Rogues (and only rogues) can use the Disable Device skill to disarm magic traps. A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the level of the spell used to create it.

A rogue who beats a trap''s DC by 10 or more with a Disable Device check can study a trap, figure out how it works, and bypass it (with her party) without disarming it.

Evasion (Ex): At 2nd level and higher, a rogue can avoid even magical and unusual attacks with great agility. If she makes a successful Reflex saving throw against an attack that normally deals half damage on a successful save, she instead takes no damage. Evasion can be used only if the rogue is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of evasion.

Trap Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, a rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps, giving her a +1 bonus on Reflex saves made to avoid traps and a +1 dodge bonus to AC against attacks made by traps. These bonuses rise to +2 when the rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th, and to +6 at 18th level.

Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.

Uncanny Dodge (Ex): Starting at 4th level, a rogue can react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She retains her Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) even if she is caught flat-footed or struck by an invisible attacker. However, she still loses her Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.

If a rogue already has uncanny dodge from a different class she automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below) instead.

Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex): A rogue of 8th level or higher can no longer be flanked. This defense denies another rogue the ability to sneak attack the character by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target does.

If a character already has uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge instead, and the levels from the classes that grant uncanny dodge stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.

Special Abilities: On attaining 10th level, and at every three levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th), a rogue gains a special ability of her choice from among the following options.

Crippling Strike (Ex): A rogue with this ability can sneak attack opponents with such precision that her blows weaken and hamper them. An opponent damaged by one of her sneak attacks also takes 2 points of Strength damage. Ability points lost to damage return on their own at the rate of 1 point per day for each damaged ability.

Defensive Roll (Ex): The rogue can roll with a potentially lethal blow to take less damage from it than she otherwise would. Once per day, when she would be reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by damage in combat (from a weapon or other blow, not a spell or special ability), the rogue can attempt to roll with the damage. To use this ability, the rogue must attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = damage dealt). If the save succeeds, she takes only half damage from the blow; if it fails, she takes full damage. She must be aware of the attack and able to react to it in order to execute her defensive roll - if she is denied her Dexterity bonus to AC, she can''t use this ability. Since this effect would not normally allow a character to make a Reflex save for half damage, the rogue''s evasion ability does not apply to the defensive roll.

Improved Evasion (Ex): This ability works like evasion, except that while the rogue still takes no damage on a successful Reflex saving throw against attacks henceforth she henceforth takes only half damage on a failed save. A helpless rogue does not gain the benefit of improved evasion.

Opportunist (Ex): Once per round, the rogue can make an attack of opportunity against an opponent who has just been struck for damage in melee by another character. This attack counts as the rogue''s attack of opportunity for that round. Even a rogue with the Combat Reflexes feat can''t use the opportunist ability more than once per round.

Skill Mastery: The rogue becomes so certain in the use of certain skills that she can use them reliably even under adverse conditions. Upon gaining this ability, she selects a number of skills equal to 3 + her Intelligence modifier. When making a skill check with one of these skills, she may take 10 even if stress and distractions would normally prevent her from doing so. A rogue may gain this special ability multiple times, selecting additional skills for it to apply to each time.

Slippery Mind (Ex): This ability represents the rogue''s ability to wriggle free from magical effects that would otherwise control or compel her. If a rogue with slippery mind is affected by an enchantment spell or effect and fails her saving throw, she can attempt it again 1 round later at the same DC. She gets only this one extra chance to succeed on her saving throw.

Feat: A rogue may gain a bonus feat in place of a special ability.

Adventurer
The rogue who favors martial training over stealth and cunning can profit if she chooses her fights carefully.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Sneak attack.

Gain: Bonus feats (as fighter).

Antiquarian
You are incredibly knowledgeable about artifacts, relics, and antiques - especially those that are religious in nature.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the trapfinding class feature.

Benefit: When examining divine items and religious relics, you gain a bonus equal to your Wisdom modifier on all Appraise checks as an extraordinary ability.

In addition, if you examine a magic item created using a spell from the cleric or paladin list, or an item with special religious significance, you can attempt a Knowledge (religion) check (DC 10 + the item''s caster level) to identify it exactly as a spell-like ability. This works like the identify spell (caster level equals your rogue level) but requires no material component and can be performed as a full round action. You can use this ability on only one item per day.

Breathstealer
Rogues are among the best dragon hunters in the world, and they have developed a special attack to counter the powerful signature ability of these great beasts. Any rogue who expects to face dragons is advised to select this class feature.

Class: Rogue.

Level: 10th, 13th, 16th, or 19th. (You can choose this alternative class feature at any of the given levels.)

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the standard rogue''s special ability granted at that level.

Benefit: If you deliver a sneak attack against a dragon, you can choose to sacrifice two or more dice of extra damage that you would normally deal to delay the creature''s next use of its breath weapon. The delay is a number of rounds equal to 1/2 the number of dice sacrificed. If the dragon is currently recharging its breath weapon, this delay replaces the normal recharge time (usually once every 1d4 rounds) if it is longer.

Multiple uses of this ability don''t stack; use only the longer delay. A dragon immune to extra damage from critical hits or sneak attacks is immune to this ability.

Changeling Rogue
The changeling rogue follows the natural proclivities of the race and its favored class, with most multiclass changelings beginning their careers as rogues in order to benefit from the class''s wide range of skills. Though he gives up some of his adventure-oriented talents, the changeling rogue gains new abilities that aid him in more mainstream settings. Focusing on social deception and manipulation, he uses and shapes his racial abilities to strong advantage.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a changeling rogue substitution level, a character must be a changeling about to take his 1st, 3rd, or 8th level of rogue.

Class Skills
Changeling rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class, plus one Knowledge skill chosen when the first racial substitution level is taken. Once this selection is made, it cannot be changed.

Skill Points at Each Level: 10 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the changeling rogue''s racial substitution levels.

Social Intuition (Ex): A changeling rogue has an uncanny awareness of the tone of any social situation in which he finds himself. This grants benefits to a number of his skill checks.

Making a Gather Information check to gain knowledge takes a changeling rogue only 1d4+1 × 10 minutes, instead of the normal 1d4+1 hours.
A gut assessment of a social situation with a Sense Motive check can be made as a full-round action instead of taking a full minute.
A changeling rogue can take 10 on Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks, even if stress or distraction would normally prevent him from doing so.
This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue''s trapfinding ability. A changeling rogue without trapfinding can still use the Search skill to find a trap whose DC is 20 or lower, and can still disarm mundane (but not magic) traps with Disable Device, just as any other character without trapfinding.

Minor Lore (Ex): Thanks to his varied personas and pursuits, a changeling rogue picks up bits of stray knowledge. Beginning at 3rd level, he gains a +1 bonus on all Knowledge checks (though this bonus doesn''t change an untrained check to a trained check), improving by +1 every three levels thereafter (to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th, and so on). In addition, whenever the rogue successfully aids another character''s Knowledge check, that character can apply this bonus on his check result (in addition to the normal bonus granted by the rogue''s aid another attempt).

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue''s trap sense ability, which can never be gained at later levels.

Mutable Anatomy (Ex): A changeling rogue learns to shift his body''s anatomy in subtle ways during combat to avoid otherwise lethal strikes. Beginning at 8th level, any time a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a changeling rogue, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. If the changeling rogue has the ability to negate critical hits or sneak attacks by some additional means (such as armor with the fortification special ability), apply the chances separately.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue''s improved uncanny dodge.

Criminal Specialist
A rogue (of other class that meets the following prerequisites) may specialize in one particular type of crime, much like a wizard might specialize in a school of magic. Such criminal specialization requires four mandatory skills and prohibits two other skills (the specialist can never put ranks into these skills, but he may still use them untrained). In addition, as long as the specialist takes an appropriate Skill Focus feat he also gains a unique special ability at the listed level, which he can use only if he maintains a maximum number of ranks in the listed skills (even if he multiclasses). Any class with all six of the listed skills as class skills qualifies and allows a member of that class to become a specialist in the listed field.

BEGGAR
As your childhood ended, the faces of those you implored for alms grew harder, causing you to learn how to feign injuries and infirmities, anything to stoke a charitable impulse. You have learned how to use those skills to protect yourself.

Level: 1st.

Prerequisites: Bluff, Disguise, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Skill Focus (Disguise);

Forbidden Skills: Disable Device and Open Lock.

Playing Possum (Ex): You may attempt to gain a temporary edge in combat by shamming a debilitating injury, such as blindness or a missing limb. This requires 1 minute of advance preparation, a disguile kit, and a Disguise check. The next intelligent foe you encounter must succeed at an opposed Spot check or else he is flat-footed against your first attack. Your first attack in the combat must be made against this foe. If you encounter multiple foes, they all get a chance to see through your disguise, but you only gain the benefit of this ability on the first attack you make.

BLACKMAILER
In your life you have developed a talent for remaining in the background while your targets committed their indiscretions. You can leap quickly into the foreground when you need to, taking your victims by surprise and using the threat of their secrets to cow them into obeying your forcefully delivered commands.

Level: 3rd.

Prerequisites: Decipher Script, Gather Information, Intimidate, Search, Skill Focus (Intimidate).

Forbidden Skills: Disable Device and Open Lock.

Vilify (Ex): You can attempt to uncover some secret humiliation of a particular foe by carefully sifting through rumor and idle Speculation. You must spend at least 8 hours chasing gossip in an area your target has frequented within the last month followed by a Gather Information check (DC 10 + target''s CR). If you succeed at this Gather Information check you may, at any time in the following month, make an Intimidate check against your target as a full-round action. At any time in the next hour, as long as you are not in combat, you may issue a command (as the spell) at your target as a standard action. The save DC of your command effect equals the result of your Intimidate check. This is a language-dependant, mind-affecting ability.

If your Gather Information check fails you must wait at least six months before trying again against that particular target. If your target simply has no humiliating indiscretions in her past (as determined by the DM) you cannot use this ability against that target.

FENCE
You learned to look for every defect in an item and never hesitate to use even the most infinitesimal flaw as grounds to lower your price. These skills proved equally useful when dealing with any kind of object, valuable or not.

Level: 6th.

Prerequisites: Appraise, Bluff, Forgery, Sense Motive, Skill Focus (Appraise).

Forbidden Skills: Climb and Tumble.

Fracture (Ex): Your trained eye can identify and exploit the subtle, hidden defects of objects. After your first successful attack against a construct or object, you may make an Appraise check (DC 15 for an object or DC 15 + creature''s CR for a construct). For every point by which you succeed at this check you can ignore one point of hardness or one point of DR for all later attacks against that construct or object. You can only use this ability with melee attacks.

GOON
You possess a singular enthusiasm for breaking legs - or heads - upon command, but you also learned to apply your intellect, to let rumor guide you to your targets and to find the kernels of truth within their pleas and evasions.

Level: 6th.

Prerequisites: Bluff, Gather Information, Intimidate, Sense Motive, Skill Focus (Intimidate).

Forbidden Skills: Decipher Script and Use Magic Device.

Browbeat (Ex): You can, as a full-round action, make a single melee attack against an opponent. If you hit and deal damage, you can immediately follow it with an Intimidate check (DC 15 + target''s CR). If you succeed in this check your foe becomes shaken until the end of your next turn. For each round you continue to attack the same target, you gain a cumulative +1 bonus on your Intimidate checks. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

KIDNAPPER
Displaying a fiendish ingenuity for knots and bindings, you drifted into criminal gangs that made their living by snatching people and holding them for ransom.

Level: 1st.

Prerequisites: Climb, Disguise, Move Silently, Use Rope, Skill Focus (Use Rope).

Forbidden Skills: Diplomacy and Tumble.

Hobble (Ex): You can attempt to restrict or bind any foe you manage to catch unawares. Whenever you face a flat-footed opponent no more than one size category larger than you, you may attempt a melee touch attack as a full-round action. You must have a length of rope at least 20 feet long in hand when you make this touch attack. If you succeed, you can wrap your target''s arms and legs in rope. Make a Use Rope check with a -4 penalty. Your target moves at half his normal speed and takes a -2 penalty to Strength and Dexterity scores until he escapes your knots, requiring a full-round action and an Escape Artist check (DC equals your Use Rope check).

LOOKOUT
While others spent their time housebreaking or shaking down tourists, you found a comfortable niche by merely offering advanced warning of approaching danger. Your keen senses made you a welcome addition to any criminal enterprise.

Level: 3rd.

Prerequisites: Hide, Listen, Move Silently, Spot, Skill Focus (Spot).

Forbidden Skills: Appraise and Disable Device.

Perceive (Su): As a full-round action, you can gain one of the following effects until your next turn: blindsense, low-light vision, scent, or tremorsense. You cannot gain an effect you already possess. This ability requires you to concentrate the entire time. If you are attacked or otherwise distracted, you must succeed at a DC 20 Concentration check or lose the effect.

PICKPOCKET
Through trial and error (and more than one night in jail), you mastered the art of taking what you needed from passersby - the fatter and wealthier the better. As you grew older, you learned the hard way that not all wealthy folk flaunted their jewels unarmed. After several lengthy stays at the local temples, you learned to identify (and disarm) those who carried protection.

Level: 6th.

Prerequisites: Hide, Move Silently, Sleight of Hand, Spot, Skill Focus (Sleight of Hand).

Forbidden Skills: Disable Device and Sense Motive.

Snatch Weapon (Ex): You can attempt to strip a creature of a sheathed weapon by making a Sleight of Hand check (DC 20 + target''s CR) as a full-round action. Your target must be flat-footed to you. You can snatch a light weapon (based on your size, not your target''s) without penalty, a one-handed weapon with a -4 penalty, and a two-handed weapon with a -8 penalty. You cannot snatch a weapon too large for you to wield. If you succeed in this check, you gain possession of the weapon. You must have enough free hands available when you attempt the snatch to wield the weapon properly (i.e., you must have at least one free hand when attempting to snatch a light or one-handed weapon and two free hands when attempting to snatch a two-handed weapon). When you use this ability, your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot checks of those nearby. The success of observers (including your victim) doesn''t prevent you from performing the snatch, just from doing it unnoticed.

Dead Levels
The rogue is the biggest offender of dead levels. Similar to the druid, the rogue is missing two special abilities out of twenty levels, but unlike the druid, the rogue has no spells to shore up these deficiencies. More unusual still is the distinctive lack of a crowning 20th-level ability to complete the class. As such, rogues can enjoy more significant dead level abilities than normal.

Makeshift Tools (Ex): At 14th level, a rogue becomes so familiar with mechanisms and traps that the character can make Disable Device checks without a set of thieves'' tools at no penalty. See Disable Device.

Skilled Saboteur (Ex): At 20th level, a rogue makes quick work out of mechanisms and traps, disabling devices in one-half the normal time. See Disable Device. A device that normally takes 1 round to disable now takes 1 standard action, allowing the character to make a move action afterward.

Death''s Ruin
You can channel the power of your faith when making sneak attacks against undead.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature, including trap sense bonuses gained at higher levels of the rogue class.

Benefit: You can make sneak attacks against undead creatures. However, you roll only one-half your normal sneak attack dice (rounded down) when determining bonus damage for such attacks. This is an extraordinary ability.


Disruptive Attack
More than perhaps any other character, a rogue''s ability to fully contribute to a fight varies dramatically based on the enemies she faces. Against a mummy, flesh golem, or shambling mound, the rogue''s damage-dealing drops precipitously. The disruptive attack alternative class feature allows a rogue to be effective in combat against such creatures by making them vulnerable to the attacks of her and her allies. It''s also useful against creatures vulnerable to your sneak attacks, creating interesting tactical decisions for you in such fights.

Level: 4th.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain uncanny dodge at 4th level. Instead, you gain uncanny dodge at 8th level (when you would normally gain improved uncanny dodge).

Benefit: Beginning at 4th level, through careful study you''re able to find exploitable flaws in any creature''s tactics and defenses. Whenever you hit a target that is flat-footed against your attack, or whenever you hit a target that you flank, you can choose to sacrifice your sneak attack damage in order to apply a -5 penalty to that creature''s AC for 1 round. Multiple hits on the same target don''t stack. This extraordinary ability works even against creatures normally immune to extra damage from sneak attacks, such as undead.

Drow Rogue
Rogues are common in drow society, fewer in number only than clerics and wizards. They are silent killers, spies, and informants. It falls to them to gather intelligence about rival houses and to eliminate challengers within the hierarchy. For these tasks, drow rogues cultivate the ability to safely utilize poison.

Poison Use
Poison is used widely in drow society. For the dark elves, it is a vital tool in the race for survival. From the popular drow sleep poison to the bevy of spider venoms extracted from Lolth''s favored creatures, drow have mastered a variety of toxins that wreak havoc with their opponents'' bodies.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the trapfinding ability gained at 1st level.

Benefit: You are trained in the use of poison. You are never at risk of accidentally poisoning yourself when applying poison to a weapon.

Dwarf Rogue
Stolid dwarf society frowns upon roguery in its usual forms, but dwarves value two things in common with most successful outlaws: wealth and skill. Dwarven engineers, respected masters of their race''s grand vaults and vast underground cities, sometimes feel the call of this combination to such an extent that they compromise their honor. Others learn engineering with the intent to destroy rather than create - to collapse tunnel ceilings on invading drow or burrow into the subterranean vaults of ancient foes.

A dwarven engineer learns to mix his mechanical aptitude with unconventional motives, finding ready employ with any adventuring party or thieves'' guild he comes across. No one builds better than a dwarf, and no one can ruin better than one either.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a dwarf rogue substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of rogue.

Class Skills
Dwarf rogue substitution levels grant class skills as the base rogue class, plus Knowledge (architecture and engineering).

Skill Points at each Level: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Dwarf Rogue Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+0	+0	+2	+0	Demolitionist, trapfinding
3rd	+2	+1	+3	+1	Expert demolitionist, trap sense +1
5th	+3	+1	+4	+1	Rapid demolitionist
Class Features
All of the following are features of the dwarf rogue''s substitution levels.

Demolitionist (Ex): A 1st-level dwarf rogue deals +1d6 points of damage against constructs and objects. This bonus does not ignore hardness or damage reduction.

This substitution replaces the rogue''s normal +1d6 points of sneak attack damage at 1st level.

Expert Demolitionist (Ex): At 3rd level, the rogue deals +2d6 points of damage against constructs and objects. This bonus does not ignore hardness or damage reduction.

In addition, she gains a +2 competence bonus on Craft, Disable Device, or Knowledge (architecture and engineering) checks made to demolish, tunnel through, or otherwise degrade the structural integrity of an object or building - or to plan to do so.

This substitution replaces the rogue''s normal +2d6 points of sneak attack damage at 3rd level.

Rapid Demolitionist (Su): A 5th-level, the rogue deals +3d6 points of damage against constructs and objects. This bonus does not ignore hardness or damage reduction.

It takes less time for a rogue to use her Craft, Disable Device, or Knowledge (architecture and engineering) checks in order to demolish, tunnel through, or otherwise degrade the structural integrity of an object or building - or to plan to do so. If the task ordinarily takes more than 1 minute to complete, it instead takes half as long. A 1-minute task requires only 5 rounds. Tasks that require a full-round action take only a standard action, and those that begin as a standard action only need a move action. A task that takes a move action or free action does not change.

This substitution replaces the rogue''s normal +3d6 points of sneak attack damage at 5th level.

Feign Death
A clever villain has many contingencies in place, so that if a plan goes awry, he can beat a hasty retreat. In exchange for some ability to evade damage, he can enter a state that is indistinguishable from death.

Class: Monk, ranger, or rogue.

Level: 2nd (monk or rogue) or 9th (ranger).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the evasion ability. If your class would grant you improved evasion at a higher level, you instead gain evasion.

Benefit: As an immediate action, you can enter a catatonic state in which you appear to be dead. While feigning death, you cannot see or feel anything, but you retain the ability to smell, hear, and otherwise follow what is going on around you.

While under the effect of this ability, you are immune to all mind-affecting spells and abilities, poison, sleep, paralysis, stunning, disease, ability drain, negative levels, and death effects. Attempts to resuscitate you, such as raise dead or reincarnation, automatically fail, though resurrection and true resurrection immediately end your feign death ability.

Spells and other effects that assess your current condition, such as status and deathwatch, indicate that you are dead. However, a character who succeeds on a Heal check (DC 15 + 1/2 your level + your Con modifier) can discern that you are actually alive.

You can remain in the catatonic state indefinitely, though you still require food, water, and air. Emerging from feigned death is a standard action.

Friend''s Evasion
By giving up one of your high-level special abilities, you''ve learned to protect others by using your own skills and abilities.

Levels: 10th, 13th, 16th, or 19th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces improved evasion as one of the rogue''s special ability choices.

Benefit: When you select friend''s evasion as a special ability, every ally adjacent to you gains evasion. This is an extraordinary ability.

Golarion Rogue
Rogues trained in shadow-shrouded Nidal are renowned for their use of poison and other vile toxins to weaken and kill their foes. This ability replaces the trap sense ability.

Poison Master (Ex): At 3rd level, the rogue can use poison without any chance of poisoning himself. For every three levels of rogue beyond 3rd, the DC for any poison coated on the rogue''s weapons increases by +1 if the target is poisoned as part of a sneak attack.

Golden Hand of Vergadain
The Golden Hands of Vergadain defend the interests of the dwarves, particularly in areas of commerce and trade. Furthermore, the members of this organization work to eliminate threats to dwarven commercial ventures and recover goods stolen from dwarf merchants. The training provided by the Golden Hands helps members track foes of the dwarves and deal with them appropriately.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a Golden Hands substitution level, a character must be a dwarf, be a member of the Golden Hands of Vergadain, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 2nd, 3rd, or 6th level of rogue.

Class Skills
A Golden Hand of Vergadain has the same selection of class skills as a standard rogue does, plus Survival.

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier.


Table: Golden Hand of Vergadain Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
2nd	+1	+0	+2	+0	Evasion, favored enemy
3rd	+2	+1	+2	+1	Sneak attack +2d6, Track
6th	+3	+2	+4	+2	Urban tracking, track bonus +1
Class Features
All the following are features of the Golden Hands substitution levels.

Favored Enemy (Ex): A Golden Hand of Vergadain can choose any organization in Faerun that opposes dwarves as a favored enemy, in the same way that a ranger chooses favored enemies. The Golden Hand gains a +2 bonus on weapon damage rolls against recognized members of the chosen organization, and a +2 bonus on Bluff, Listen, Sense Motive, Spot, and Survival checks when using these skills against such individuals. This ability cannot be used to "detect" members of the chosen organization, and it applies only against actual members. Thus, the Golden Hand cannot simply declare someone a member to gain the bonuses.

This benefit replaces the +1 bonus on Reflex saves that a standard rogue gains at 2nd level. From this point forward, the Golden Hand''s Reflex save modifier is 1 point lower than that of a standard rogue.

Track: A Golden Hand of Vergadain gains Track as a bonus feat.

This benefit replaces the trap sense class feature that a standard rogue gains at 3rd level. Any time thereafter that the Golden Hand would normally gain an increase in the trap sense ability, he gains a +1 bonus on any check made to track instead.

Urban Tracking (Ex): A Golden Hand of Vergadain can use the Gather Information skill to track targets in an urban setting. The tracking DCs and results are the same, but the skill used is different.

This benefit replaces the +1 base attack bonus that a standard rogue gains at 6th level. From this point forward, the Golden Hand''s base attack bonus is 1 point lower than that of a standard rogue.

Goliath Rogue
Although the ponderous goliath might seem ill suited to the stealthy life of a rogue, tribes rely on rogue scouts to help them survive in their hostile environments. Goliath rogues embrace their people''s toughness and durability in exchange for some of the rogue''s traditional agility.

Hit Die: d8.

Requirements
To take a goliath rogue substitution level, a character must be a goliath about to take her 2nd, 3rd, or 8th level of rogue.

Class Skills
Goliath rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class plus Survival (Wis).

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier.


Table: Goliath Rogue Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
2nd	+1	+0	+3	+0	Mettle of mountains
3rd	+2	+1	+3	+1	Sneak attack +2d6, wild sense +1
8th	+6/+1	+2	+6	+2	Fortification
Class Features
All the following are features of the goliath rogue''s racial substitution levels.

Mettle of Mountains (Ex): A goliath rogue who takes the 2nd-level racial substitution level has durability that allows her to shrug off magical effects that would otherwise harm her. She gains a +4 bonus on her Fortitude saves.

If the goliath rogue makes a successful Fortitude saving throw that would normally reduce a spell''s effect, she suffers no effect from the spell at all. Only those spells with a Saving Throw entry of "Fortitude partial," "Fortitude half," or similar entries can be negated through this ability.

If the goliath rogue later gains improved evasion as a rogue special ability, her mettle of mountains ability improves instead. Now, while she still suffers no effect on a successful Fortitude saving throw against a spell or ability as described above, a failed Fortitude save results in the effect that a successful Fortitude save would normally bring about. For instance, a goliath rogue would take no damage from a disintegrate spell if she succeeded on her Fortitude save, and would only take 5d6 points of damage if she failed the save.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue''s 2nd-level evasion ability.

Wild Sense (Ex): A goliath rogue who takes the 3rd-level racial substitution level becomes more in tune with her natural surroundings. She gains a +1 bonus on Knowledge (nature) checks and Survival checks in aboveground natural environments. This bonus increases to +2 when the goliath rogue reaches 6th level, to +3 when she reaches 9th level, to +4 when she reaches 12th level, to +5 at 15th level, and to +6 at 18th level.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue''s 3rd-level trap sense ability, as well as the higher-level improvements of the ability.

Fortification (Ex): A goliath rogue who takes the 8thlevel racial substitution level develops a tough hide that allows her extra protection against potentially devastating attacks. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on a goliath rogue with this substitution benefit, there is a 25% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue''s 8th-level improved uncanny dodge ability.

Halfling Rogue
A halfling takes to life as a rogue as if born to it - a claim with which many other races would readily agree. A halfling rogue gives up some of her prowess in melee combat in exchange for increased talent with thrown weapons and an extra touch of halfling luck.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a half ling rogue substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 10th level of rogue.

Class Skills
Halfling rogue substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard rogue class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Halfling Rogue Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+0	+0	+2	+0	Ranged sneak attack +2d6, melee sneak attack +0, trapfinding
3rd	+2	+1	+3	+1	Ranged sneak attack +3d6, melee sneak attack +1d6, thief''s luck
10th	+7/+2	+3	+7	+3	Sniping mastery
Class Features
All the following are features of the halfling rogue''s racial substitution levels.

Ranged Sneak Attack (Ex): A halfling rogue is particularly talented at delivering sneak attacks with slings and thrown weapons. Whenever a halfling rogue delivers a ranged sneak attack with a thrown weapon or sling, she deals an extra 1d6 points of damage. However, her melee sneak attack damage is reduced by 1d6 (0 points of damage at 1st level, an extra 1d6 points at 3rd level, an extra 2d6 points at 5th level, and so forth, to a maximum of an extra 9d6 points at 19th level).

This ability doesn''t give the halfling rogue the ability to deal sneak attack damage to creatures she otherwise couldn''t affect (whether due to their anatomy, concealment, range, or any other reason).

This substitution feature augments, but does not replace, the standard rogue''s sneak attack ability.

Thief''s Luck (Ex): At 3rd level, a halfling rogue gains a second chance against certain dangers. She can reroll any Reflex save she has just rolled. If she chooses to use this ability (which must be decided before the result of the original save is known), she must abide by the second roll. She may use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every three levels gained thereafter. She can''t use this ability more than once per round.

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue''s ability of trap sense. A halfling rogue with this substitution feature never gains trap sense from rogue levels.

Sniping Mastery (Ex): A halfling rogue who has hidden at least 10 feet away from her target can make one or more ranged attacks, then immediately hide again as a free action. She takes only a -10 penalty on her Hide check to do so (rather than the normal -20; see Sniping).

This substitution feature replaces the standard rogue''s special ability gained at 10th level.

Holy Stalker
When you give up one of your high-level special abilities, you gain a link to divine power that helps you destroy undead. This divine energy comes to you through your religious beliefs but is tied to your own natural abilities in subterfuge.

Levels: 10th, 13th, 16th, or 19th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces crippling strike as one of the rogue''s special ability choices. Only non-evil rogues can select this class feature.

Benefit: When you select holy stalker as a special ability, you can channel positive energy into your sneak attacks to damage undead creatures.

When you successfully damage an undead creature in a situation in which you would normally apply sneak attack damage, you add 2 points of positive energy damage per sneak attack die you would normally roll. This ability can be used in conjunction with death''s ruin. This is a supernatural ability.

Kobold Rogue
Kobold rogues pride themselves on their comprehensive understanding of trap dynamics. Trapmaking is an art, a passion, and a racial pastime. Many kobolds dabble in trapmaking, and kobold rogues who do so gain additional insights into dealing with such devices. Kobold rogues are notoriously cowardly and fragile, however, and greatly prefer stealth and retreat over face-to-face conflict.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a kobold rogue substitution level, a character must be a kobold about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 8th level of rogue.

Class Skills
Kobold rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class, plus Knowledge (dungeoneering).

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Kobold Rogue Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+0	+0	+2	+0	Rapid retreat, shrewd trapfinding +2, sneak attack +1d6
3rd	+2	+1	+3	+1	Improved trap sense +2, shrewd trapfinding +4, sneak attack +2d6
8th	+6/+1	+2	+6	+2	Evasive skitter, shrewd trapfinding +6
Class Features
All the following are class features of the kobold rogue racial substitution levels.

Rapid Retreat (Ex): A kobold rogue who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains the ability to retreat quickly from dangerous situations. Any time a kobold rogue with this substitution feature uses the withdraw action, she gains a 5-foot bonus to her speed.

Shrewd Trapfinding (Ex): Starting at 1st level, each time a kobold rogue takes a substitution level, she gains a cumulative +2 competence bonus on Search checks to find traps and on Disable Device checks to disarm traps.

This bonus is lost if the kobold rogue does not have a number of ranks in Craft (trapmaking) equal to or greater than her rogue class level.

This substitution feature alters but does not replace the standard rogue''s trapfinding class feature.

Improved Trap Sense (Ex): At 3rd level, a kobold rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her to danger from traps. This is the same as the rogue''s trap sense class feature, except that the bonus granted on Reflex saves and to AC is +2 instead of +1. A kobold rogue''s trap sense continues to improve at the normal rate (to +3 at 6th level, +4 at 9th, and so on).

This extra bonus is lost, reducing the kobold rogue''s trap sense bonus to the normal rogue value if the kobold rogue does not have a number of ranks in Craft (trapmaking) equal to or greater than her rogue class level. This substitution feature augments the standard rogue''s trap sense class feature.

Evasive Skitter (Ex): A kobold rogue who takes the 8th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to move out of the area of dangerous spells and effects. A kobold rogue who succeeds on a Reflex save against a spell or effect gains the normal benefit for the successful save, and she can choose to move out of the area of the spell or effect. She must take the shortest path available to her, and she can''t move farther than her speed. If more than one path of equal distance is available, she can choose which path to use. If no such path is available, the kobold rogue can''t use this ability. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal for movement.

For example, a kobold rogue with a speed of 30 feet is within the area of a fireball spell. She successfully saves against the spell, so she takes no damage from the blast and can move out of the spell''s area by the shortest route available.

This substitution feature replaces the standard 8th-level rogue''s improved uncanny dodge class feature.

Lightbringer Strike
Creatures immune to sneak attack reduction are a bane to rogues everywhere. Particularly in ancient tombs where undead are common, rogues must rely on their wits to survive. You have spent significant time studying this problem and have learned ways to strike harm even these resilient opponents.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain trap sense.

Benefit: Whenever you flank a creature that is immune to sneak attack damage, you still gain half of your sneak attack dice as bonus damage. Note that this benefit does not extend to creatures that ignore your sneak attack damage because you cannot flank them. In addition, you still cannot gain sneak attack damage against such foes if they are flat-footed. You must flank a creature that is immune to sneak attack damage in order to use this ability.

Lunar Rogue
Lunar rogues call upon the essence of the moon to empower themselves, gaining the ability to rage and use a few moon-oriented spell-like abilities not normally available to rogues. This variant rogue gains all the class features of the standard rogue, except as noted.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a lunar rogue substitution level, a character must worship the moon and be about to take her 4th, 8th, or 10th level of rogue.

Class Skills
Lunar rogue substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier.


Table: Lunar Rogue Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
4th	+3	+1	+4	+1	Raging Rogue
8th	+6/+1	+2	+6	+2	Changing Rogue
10th	+7/+2	+3	+7	+3	Empowered Rogue
Class Features
All of the following are features of the lunar rogue''s substitution levels.

Raging Rogue (Ex): At 4th level, a lunar rogue gains the ability to draw the moon''s emotion into her, driving her into a rage, as a barbarian, once per day. This ability does not grant the rogue access to the greater rage, tireless rage, or mighty rage barbarian abilities, unless she also has the appropriate level in the barbarian class.

This ability replaces the standard rogue''s uncanny dodge ability.

Changing Rogue (Su): At 8th level, a lunar rogue learns one of the moon''s secrets, gaining the ability to use either greater invisibility or polymorph as a spell-like ability once per day (choose one - you cannot later change your selection). This ability may only target the lunar rogue. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to her rogue class level.

This ability replaces the standard rogue''s improved uncanny dodge ability.

Empowered Rogue (Su): At 10th level, a lunar rogue discovers the moon''s true power and gains the ability to use either dominate person or true seeing as a spell-like ability once per day (choose one - you cannot later change your selection). The true seeing ability may only target the lunar rogue. The caster level for this spell-like ability equals her rogue class level. A saving throw against the dominate person has a DC of 10 + 1/2 the rogue''s class level + her Charisma modifier.

This ability replaces the standard rogue''s special ability at 10th level. Additional special abilities gained by a rogue after 10th level are treated as normal.

Mimic
Many villains specialize in avoiding detection so that they can work behind the scenes to achieve their nefarious goals. To this end, they spend a fair amount of time developing techniques to mask their appearance, at the expense of their normal training in foiling traps.

Class: Rogue.

Level: 1st, 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th.

Special Requirement: You must have a Charisma of 12 or higher to select this alternative class feature.

Replaces: If you select this feature, you do not gain the trapfinding ability.

Benefit: Once per day, you can use disguise self as a caster whose level equals your class level. At 3rd level and every three levels thereafter, you can reduce your bonus on trap sense by 1 to gain an additional use of mimic.

At your discretion, when using disguise self, you can spend two uses of the spell-like ability to produce the effect as a swift action rather than a standard action.

Penetrating Strike
Creatures that have immunity to extra damage from sneak attacks are a bane to rogues everywhere. Particularly in ancient tombs where undead are common, rogues must rely on their wits to survive. You have spent a significant amount of time studying this problem and have learned ways to harm even such resilient opponents.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain trap sense.

Benefit: Whenever you flank a creature that is immune to extra damage from sneak attacks, you still deal extra damage equal to half your normal sneak attack dice. This benefit does not apply against creatures that cannot be flanked, nor against foes that are otherwise denied their Dexterity bonus to AC or flat-footed but not flanked.

Planar Rogue
The only thing more varied and unpredictable than a rogue''s intentions are the infinite planes of reality. No matter what a rogue wants to do, no matter what treasure or information or experience she seeks, it can be found somewhere on the planes.

A rogue who spends her life exploring the twisting realities and the gossamer walls that separate them comes away with a unique insight into the way the cosmos functions. She may not have a scholar''s ability to understand it, nor a poet''s skill to describe it, but the rogue has something eminently more useful - she knows the loopholes built into the laws of reality and how to bend them ever so slightly to her advantage.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a rogue planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 6th, 10th, or 16th level of rogue.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Rogue planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard rogue class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier.


Table: Rogue Planar Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
6th	+4	+2	+5	+2	Breach sense
10th	+7/+2	+3	+7	+3	Slip the bonds
16th	+12/+7/+2	+5	+10	+5	Blink
Class Features
All of the following are features of the rogue''s planar substitution levels.

Breach Sense (Ex): A 6th-level planar rogue gains an intuitive sense that alerts her of the imminent opening of a nearby conduit between the planes. She automatically detects the activation of any portal or the opening of any planar breach within 30 feet of her, as well as any spell or effect that crosses over or through the planes (such as summon monster, teleport, or plane shift) used within 30 feet of her. The rogue may immediately attempt a DC 25 Spot check to pinpoint the exact location of the portal, breach, or effect, as long as she has line of sight to it.

For example, a planar rogue would detect a demon teleporting to a spot within 30 feet of her, and with a DC 25 Spot check could even pinpoint the precise location where the demon appeared (though she would lose this precision as soon as the demon moved).

This benefit replaces the improvement to the trap sense class feature gained by a standard rogue at 6th level. From now on, whenever the rogue gains a standard rogue level that grants an improvement to her trap sense, she gains the indicated bonus minus 1 (trap sense +2 at 9th level, trap sense +3 at 12th level, and so on).

Slip the Bonds (Su): A rogue who chooses this substitution benefit at 10th level knows how to slip momentarily into the periphery of the plane she is on. Once per day as a free action, she can turn ethereal for a single round.

This benefit replaces the special ability gained by a standard rogue at 10th level.

Blink (Sp): By 16th level, a planar rogue''s understanding of how to skirt the periphery of a plane is such that she can use a blink effect on herself once per day. This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 her rogue level (rounded down).

This benefit replaces the special ability gained by a standard rogue at 16th level.

Quick Fingers
Sometimes only a few seconds make the difference between stopping the descent of a spiked ceiling and coming to a messy end. Through countless hours of practice, you have learned to make quick work of traps. But this speed comes at a price. Because you focus on disarming traps, you react more slowly when a trap activates.

Level: 3rd.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain trap sense +1 at 3rd level. Instead, you gain trap sense +1 at 6th level, with an additional increase of +1 every four levels thereafter (to a maximum of +4 at 18th level).

Benefit: When you use Disable Device to disarm a trap, the time required to perform the check is reduced. Use the following table in place of the one on the Disable Device skill description.

Device	Time	Disable Device DC
Simple	1 move action	10
Tricky	1 standard action	15
Difficult	1 full-round action	20
Wicked	1d4 rounds	25+

Rilkan Rogue
A rilkan rogue is typically a silver-tongued trickster or charlatan, or perhaps simply a charismatic daredevil. She relies on personality and passion for adventure to win the day. Despite her considerable talents of interaction and deception, though, she is quite capable of holding her own in a fight - all the better to survive the anger of a deceived merchant or a spurned suitor.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a rilkan rogue substitution level, a character must be a rilkan about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 10th level of rogue.

Class Skills
Rilkan rogue substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard rogue class, plus Speak Language.

Skill Points at Each Level: 8 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Rilkan Rogue Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special
1st	+0	+0	+2	+0	Trapfinding, improved flanking
3rd	+2	+1	+3	+1	Sneak attack +1d6, bardic knowledge, bonus feat
10th	+7/+2	+3	+7	+3	Fortunate reflexes
Class Features
All of the following are features of the rilkan rogue racial substitution levels.

Improved Flanking (Ex): A rilkan rogue who is flanking an opponent gains a +4 bonus on attacks instead of a +2 bonus on attacks. Any other rilkans flanking the same opponent also benefit from this improved bonus. Other, nonrilkan characters flanking with the rilkan rogue don''t gain this increased bonus.

This benefit replaces a standard rogue''s sneak attack ability gained at 1st level. Instead, a rilkan rogue gains sneak attack at 3rd level and reduces the extra damage dice indicated by 1d6.

Bardic Knowledge (Ex): A rilkan rogue picks up a lot of stray knowledge while interacting with others. Starting at 3rd level, she can make a special bardic knowledge check with a bonus equal to her rogue level plus her Intelligence modifier to see whether she knows some relevant information about local notable people, legendary items, or significant places. This is otherwise identical to the bard''s class feature of the same name.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue''s trap sense class feature gained at 3rd level. A rilkan rogue who selects this substitution feature never gains trap sense from her rogue levels.

Bonus Feat: At 3rd level, a rilkan rogue selects one of the following feats as a bonus feat: Deceitful, Diligent, Investigator, Negotiator, or Persuasive.

Fortunate Reflexes (Ex): A rilkan rogue enjoys living life on the edge, taking risks that other rogues might avoid. Beginning at 10th level, a rilkan rogue can choose to reroll any failed Reflex save. The rogue must take the result of the reroll, even if it''s worse than the original roll. If the original roll is a natural 1, the rilkan rogue can''t use this ability.

This benefit replaces the standard rogue''s special ability gained at 10th level. Furthermore, a rilkan rogue forever forfeits the ability to gain improved evasion as a rogue class feature. (She can still gain improved evasion from some other source.)

Special Abilities
As rogues hone their skills they sometimes discover new, almost supernatural ways to manifest their talents. Presented here are several new options for rogue special abilities. Rogues have the option to choose their special abilities at higher levels, and the options in this article are similar to those already outlined in the rogue''s description.

Accurate Fall (Ex): Dancing upon currents and eddies in the air the rogue may aim where she falls, often managing to land in just the right spot to minimize injury. Whenever the rogue falls she may attempt a Reflex save to convert half the damage from the fall into nonlethal damage. The DC of the save depends upon the type of surface upon which the rogue falls.

Surface	DC
Liquid (water, quicksand)	18
Soft (lava, mud, haystack)	20
Yielding (underbrush, tent canopy)	22
Hard (stone, building roof)	24
Uneven (spikes, stalagmites)	26
The rogue may also make a Tumble check in order to reduce the lethal damage further.

Prerequisite: Must have survived taking 20d6 points of damage from falling.

Adrenaline Rush (Ex): Brought to the brink of death by massive trauma the rogue somehow survived. As a result, she developed a talent for pushing her body beyond its normal limits. Once per day, the rogue may choose to treat a Strength-based skill check as if she had rolled a natural 20. The rogue must declare she is using this ability before the die roll, thereby negating the necessity of the check.

Prerequisite: Must have succeeded at a Fortitude save to avoid death due to massive damage.

Cartilaginous Skeleton (Ex): The rogue''s shattered bones knit back together under a sheath of flexible cartilage, allowing her to contort herself in remarkable ways. The rogue gains a +4 bonus on Escape Artist checks and an additional +2 bonus when at tempting to escape a grapple. Further, if subject to a grapple she may make an attack of opportunity against the grappling opponent even if it has the Improved Grapple feat or the improved grab special attack.

Prerequisite: Must have been reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by bludgeoning damage or a crushing attack.

Enriched Bone Marrow (Ex): The rogue''s recovery from near-fatal blood loss left her better able to recuperate from physical disability. Each day in which the rogue attempts to recover ability damage to her Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution, she may attempt a Fortitude save (DC 15 + current amount of ability damage) to recover an extra point of ability damage.

Prerequisite: Constitution must have been reduced below 3 by blood-draining attacks.

Façade (Ex): When the rogue disguises himself, he delves so deeply into character that he fools even divination magic. Whenever a creature casts a divination spell (or uses an ability that reproduces the effect of such a spell) that affects the rogue while he''s disguised, the creature must make a Spot check opposed by the rogue''s Disguise check. If the Spot check fails, the divination spell perceives the rogue as radiating the aura and thoughts that the rogue wishes the effect to detect. For instance, a rogue disguised as a zombie might radiate a neutral evil aura, detect as undead, and would have no discernible thoughts for a detect thoughts spell to pick up. Such a rogue would not suffer any ill effects from such a perfect disguise, such as extra harm from a holy or bane weapons.

Face in the Crowd (Ex): The rogue develops an uncanny ability to blend in while among large numbers of people. When within a crowd, the rogue may use the Hide skill even while being observed. For the purposes of this effect, a crowd consists of at least ten creatures at least half the rogue''s size within a 10-foot radius of the rogue.

Fear Mirror (Su): Having faced and overcome the most terrifying thing she can imagine, the rogue may reflect similar horrors back at her foes. When targeted by a fear effect the rogue instinctively projects the attack back to its source. Both the rogue and the source of the fear effect must make any applicable saving throws to resist the effects of the attack. Any immunities possessed by the source of the attack still apply.

Prerequisite: Must have succeeded at a Fortitude save to resist phantasmal killer.

Frostfell Terrain Mastery (Ex): The rogue can move about in frostfell environments with great ease and quickness. As long as she is in a cold terrain or region of frostfell (or in a city located in such a region), the rogue gains a +2 competence bonus on initiative checks and a +10-foot bonus to her land speed. She loses these bonuses when she is wearing medium or heavy armor, or is carrying a medium or heavy load.

Handwriting Analysis (Ex): Trained to scrutinize the whorls and loops of a person''s writing along with choices of words and imagery, the rogue may make startlingly accurate deductions about a person from handwriting alone. Upon making a successful Decipher Script check, the rogue may attempt to learn further information about the writer. The result of this Decipher Script check reveals specific traits and all facts of a lesser DC as noted in the following table. For example, a rogue who makes a Decipher Script check and exceeds the DC by 5 reveals the relative age, race, and gender of the writer.

When attempting to use this ability to sniff out a forgery (for instance, to see if a love letter purportedly written by a princess was actually composed by a female of her age, race, and gender) use the Forgery skill check of the forger in lieu of a Decipher Script DC. By succeeding at a Decipher Script check opposed by the forger''s Forgery check, the rogue may attempt to reveal information about the forger as normal.

Fact	Decipher Script Check
Gender	Meets DC
Race	Exceeds the DC by 2
Relative age*	Exceeds the DC by 5
Highest level class	Exceeds the DC by 10
Law vs. chaos alignment axis	Exceeds the DC by 15
Good vs. evil alignment axis	Exceeds the DC by 20
* Child, adult, middle aged, old, or venerable.
Happier Days (Ex): At the moment of crisis the rogue''s life did indeed pass before her eyes, and now she may draw upon memories of better times to sustain her when enemies assault her psyche. Once per day, if the rogue must attempt a Will save she may instead choose to cast her mind adrift among her memories rather then suffer the effects of a possible failed save. She must decide to use this ability before she attempts the Will save, negating the need for the saving throw. While lost in her memories she is oblivious to her surroundings and becomes helpless. Each round, at the end of her turn, the rogue may attempt to pull her thoughts back to the present attempting a Will save (at the same DC of the original Will save). For each round she fails this save she remains helpless.

Prerequisite: Must have made a saving throw to resist a death effect.

Heart of Stone (Ex): A brush with petrification left the rogue''s organs stronger and more resilient, offering her protection from certain kinds of injuries. The rogue gains DR 5/-, but only against the extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, the rogue adds her class level to the amount of damage required to trigger a Fortitude save to resist death due to massive damage.

Prerequisite: Must have successfully resisted a petrification attack.

Ice in the Veins (Ex): Intense cold brings with it a strange lethargy and somehow, to the detriment of her enemies, the experience lingers within the rogue''s bloodstream. Any creature not immune to cold or sleep effects that bites the rogue must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the rogue''s class level + the rogue''s Constitution modifier) or become fatigued for 1 round per 2 rogue class levels. Once affected by this ability, further bites extend the duration but do not otherwise stack.

Prerequisite: Must have been reduced to fewer than 0 hit points by a cold attack.

Knockout Blow (Ex): When a rogue would make a sneak attack that deals nonlethal damage, she may instead attempt to stun her opponent before rolling her attack. If she hits, her opponent must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 15 + per die of sneak attack damage) or be stunned for 1d3 rounds.

Light Sleeper (Ex): The rogue''s sensitivity to the slightest sound becomes so acute that it is almost impossible for him to fail to react to danger. The rogue no longer suffers a -10 penalty to Listen checks while asleep.

Painful Strike: The rogue''s knowledge of anatomy allows her to inflict tremendous pain. The rogue must make a sneak attack attempt with an unarmed strike. If she hits, her target must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per die of sneak attack damage + Intelligence modifier). If the target fails this save, he must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + 1 per die of sneak attack damage + spell level) to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability for the next 1d6 rounds. The target suffers only normal damage for the unarmed strike, not sneak attack damage, when a rogue uses this ability.

Rainbow Stare (Su): Somehow, while enduring a nearly overwhelming array of colors and light the rogue learned how to screen out dangerous images. She gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against figments and glamers and is completely immune to patterns.

Prerequisite: Must have survived passing through at least four layers of either a prismatic sphere or a prismatic wail.

Saboteur (Ex): The rogue''s perception becomes so honed that he instantly notices even the most minute flaws in objects, enabling him to strike at their vulnerable points. When attacking objects or making a sunder attack action, the rogue may ignore an amount of hardness up to half his rogue class level. Further, constructs are no longer immune to the rogue''s sneak attacks.

Swift Kick (Ex): Effortlessly examining mechanical devices, the rogue may affect them with a vigorous jolt. The rogue no longer needs tools to use the Disable Device skill (although he still gains the +2 circumstance bonus when using masterwork thieves'' tools). In addition, the time it takes the rogue to use the Disable Device skill is reduced by one step. Difficult and wicked devices now require 1d4 rounds to disable, tricky devices require 1 round, and a simple device can be disabled as a free action.

Toxic Blood (Ex): A permanent residue of poison courses through the rogue''s veins. Any creature not immune to poison that bites the rogue must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + half the rogue''s class level + the rogue''s Constitution modifier) or immediately take 1 point of Constitution damage. Once triggered, this ability does not function again for 1 hour.

Prerequisite: Constitution must have been reduced below 3 by poison.


Spell Reflection
Many masters of stealth share the signature talent to avoid explosive blasts of magical energy. It takes only a little training, however, to twist this defensive flair into the ability to reflect magical attacks back upon their creator.

Class: Monk, ranger, rogue, or scout.

Level: 2nd (monk or rogue), 5th (scout), or 9th (ranger).

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain evasion. (If you would later gain improved evasion as a special ability, you gain evasion instead.)

Benefit: You gain the supernatural ability to reflect magical attacks back on their caster. If an enemy misses with a spell or spell-like ability aimed at you, you can use an immediate action to redirect the effect back at its originator. The spell or ability attacks the original caster (who makes a new attack roll using the same modifier as the original attack). If it hits, the caster is subject to the normal effect of the spell or ability.

For example, if a 3rd-level wizard missed you with a scorching ray, you could use an immediate action to redirect the ray back to the wizard. The wizard would immediately make a new ranged attack roll (using the same modifier) against his own touch AC; if the attack succeeds, the scorching ray deals its normal damage to the wizard.

This effect applies only to spells and spell-like abilities that require an attack roll. Other spells and spell-like abilities that affect a target aren''t subject to this reflection.

If a single spell or ability misses you more than once at the same time (such as scorching ray cast by a high-level caster), you can redirect each portion of the spell that missed. Using the example above, if you were missed by two of the three rays from an 11th-level wizard''s scorching ray spell, you could redirect only those two rays (but not the one that hit).

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + your Dex modifier (minimum 1/day).

Spell Sense
Most barbarians and rogues have a preternatural awareness of danger, whether the threat of a nearby invisible attacker or the hidden peril of a spear trap. Some, however, fine-tune this ability to focus on magical attacks, granting them the ability to dodge the orbs, rays, and eldritch blasts of their enemies.

Class: Barbarian or rogue.

Level: 3rd.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: You do not gain the trap sense class feature (or any later improvements to that class feature).

Benefit: Beginning at 3rd level, you gain a +1 dodge bonus to your AC against spells and spell-like abilities. This bonus increases by 1 for every three barbarian or rogue levels thereafter (to +2 at 6th level, +3 at 9th level, and so on to a maximum of +6 at 18th level). This is an extraordinary ability.

Uncanny Bravery
Many barbarian tribes revere dragons, while others see them as akin to natural disasters. Regardless, some barbarians learn to steel themselves against the bloodcurdling fear that these great beasts can create in weak-minded targets.

This ability also benefits rogues who try to plunder dragon hoards. Although they hope to complete the task without awakening the dragon, only the truly stupid fail to plan for such a possibility.

Class: Barbarian or rogue.

Level: 5th (barbarian) or 8th (rogue).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain improved uncanny dodge.

Benefit: You are immune to the frightful presence of dragons. You gain a +4 morale bonus on saving throws against all other forms of fear.

Wilderness Rogue
The wilderness rogue prefers to put her skills to use in the great outdoors, rather than in cramped alleys and dungeon corridors. In many ways, she is similar to the traditional ranger, though with less combat savvy and with none of the ranger''s divine link to the natural world.

Class Skills
Remove the following rogue class skills from the wilderness rogue''s class skill list: Appraise, Diplomacy, Decipher Script, Forgery, and Gather Information.

Add the following skills to the wilderness rogue''s class skill list: Handle Animal, Knowledge (geography), Knowledge (nature), Ride, and Survival.

Class Features
The wilderness rogue has all the standard rogue class features, except as noted below.

Special Abilities: Add woodland stride (as the 7th-level ranger ability), camouflage (as the 13th-level ranger ability), and hide in plain sight (as the 17th-level ranger ability, requires the rogue to already have the camouflage ability) to the list of special abilities that can be chosen by the wilderness rogue.',

    description = 'Sorcerers create magic the way a poet creates poems, with inborn talent honed by practice. They have no books, no mentors, no theories - just raw power that they direct at will. Some sorcerers claim that the blood of dragons courses through their veins. That claim may even be true in some cases - it is common knowledge that certain powerful dragons can take humanoid form and even have humanoid lovers, and it''s difficult to prove that a given sorcerer does not have a dragon ancestor. It''s true that sorcerers often have striking good looks, usually with a touch of the exotic that hints at an unusual heritage. Others hold that the claim is either an unsubstantiated boast on the part of certain sorcerers or envious gossip on the part of those who lack the sorcerer''s gift.

The typical sorcerer adventures in order to improve his abilities. Only by testing his limits can he expand them. A sorcerer''s power is inborn - part of his soul. Developing this power is a quest in itself for many sorcerers, regardless of how they wish to use their power. Some good sorcerers are driven by the need to prove themselves. Marked as different by their power, they seek to win a place in society and to prove themselves to others. Evil sorcerers, however, also feel themselves set apart from others - apart and above. They adventure to gain power over those they look down upon.

Sorcerers cast spells through innate power rather than through careful training and study. Their magic is intuitive rather than logical. Sorcerers know fewer spells than wizards do and acquire powerful spells more slowly than wizards, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare their spells ahead of time. Sorcerers do not specialize in certain schools of magic the way wizards sometimes do. Since sorcerers gain their powers without undergoing the years of rigorous study that wizards go through, they don''t have the background of arcane knowledge than most wizards have. However, they do have more time to learn fighting skills, and they are proficient with simple weapons.

For a sorcerer, magic is an intuitive art, not a science. Sorcery favors the free, chaotic, creative spirit over the disciplined mind, so sorcerers tend slightly toward chaos over law.

Some sorcerers favor Boccob (god of magic), while others revere Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic). However, many sorcerers follow some other deity, or none at all. (Wizards typically learn to follow Boccob or Wee Jas from their mentors, but most sorcerers are self-taught, with no master to induct them into a religion).

Sorcerers develop rudimentary powers at puberty. Their first spells are incomplete, spontaneous, uncontrolled, and sometimes dangerous. A household with a budding sorcerer in it may be troubled by strange sounds or lights, which can create the impression that the place is haunted. Eventually, the young sorcerer understands the power that he has been wielding unintentionally. From that point on, he can begin practicing and improving his powers. Sometimes a sorcerer is fortunate enough to come under the care of an older, more experienced sorcerer, someone who can help him understand and use his new powers. More often, however, sorcerers are on their own, feared by erstwhile friends and misunderstood by family. Sorcerers have no sense of identity as a group. Unlike wizards, they gain little by sharing their knowledge and have no strong incentive to work together.

Most sorcerers are humans or half-elves, but the innate talent for sorcery is unpredictable, and it can show up in any of the common races. Arcane spellcasters from savage lands or from among the brutal humanoids are more likely to be sorcerers than wizards. Kobolds are especially likely to take up this path, and they are fierce, if inarticulate, proponents of the "blood of the dragons" theory.

Sorcerers find that they have the most in common with members of other largely self-taught classes, such as druids and rogues. They sometimes find themselves at odds with members of the more disciplined classes, such as paladins and monks. Since they cast the same spells as wizards but do so in a different way, they sometimes find themselves in competition with wizards.

A sorcerer tends to define his role based on his spell selection. A sorcerer who focuses on damage-dealing spells becomes a center of the party''s offensive power. Another may rely on more subtle magics, such as charms and illusions, and thus take a quieter role. A party with a sorcerer should strongly consider including a second spellcaster, such as a bard, cleric, druid, or even a wizard, to make up for the sorcerer''s lack of versatility. Since a sorcerer often has a powerful presence that gives him a way with people, he may serve as the "face" for an adventuring party, negotiating, bargaining, and speaking for others. The sorcerer''s spells often help him sway others or gain information, so he makes an excellent spy or diplomat for an adventuring party.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Skills
The sorcerer''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (arcana) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Sorcerers are proficient with all simple weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a sorcerer''s gestures, which can cause his spells with somatic components to fail.

Spells: A sorcerer casts arcane spells which are drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. He can cast any spell he knows without preparing it ahead of time, the way a wizard or a cleric must (see below).

To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a sorcerer''s spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer''s Charisma modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Sorcerer. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Charisma score.

A sorcerer''s selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new sorcerer level, he gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by his Charisma score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of by study. The sorcerer can''t use this method of spell acquisition to learn spells at a faster rate, however.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one he already knows. In effect, the sorcerer "loses" the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell''s level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged, and it must be at least two levels lower than the highest-level sorcerer spell the sorcerer can cast. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that he gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare his spells in advance. He can cast any spell he knows at any time, assuming he has not yet used up his spells per day for that spell level. He does not have to decide ahead of time which spells he''ll cast.

Familiar: A sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.

The sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.

If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the sorcerer, the sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a sorcerer''s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar''s demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

Aligned Spellcaster
Your passions drive your magical abilities, imbuing your every spell with the power of your conviction. Those who oppose your ideals suffer the most from your magical energy.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Choose an alignment component you have that is not neutral. Spells you cast gain the apropriate alignment descriptor unless they already have the opposite alignment descriptor. For example, a neutral good wizard who selects this ability (and who must choose good) casts all spells that aren''t evil spells as good spells.

Spells you cast that target creatures of the opposite alignment are cast at +1 caster level (+2 if they have the opposite alignment as a subtype). Area of effect and other spells that affect such creatures without targeting them do not gain this bonus. A neutral spellcaster gains no benefit from this ability.

Arcane Reabsorption
You have always focused more on the raw manipulation of arcane energy than others of your profession. As such, you know how to possibly regain that energy when outside forces attempt to disrupt your magic.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Whenever a targeted spell you cast fails to penetrate a creature''s spell resistance or is countered by another spellcaster, you can immediately attempt to reabsorb the arcane energy you just spent as an immediate action. The spell can have no effect at all in order to use this ability. By making a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + [spell level × 3]), you regain the spell as if it was never cast (or regain the spell slot if you cast spells spontaneously). Attempting this taxes your body. Regardless of the success of the check, you take 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level you attempt to reabsorb. This damage is internal and bypasses damage reduction and resistances you possess.


Battle Sorcerer
The battle sorcerer is no weak arcanist, hiding behind the fighters. Instead, she is a capable physical combatant who mixes magical prowess with fighting skill.

Hit Die: d8.

Base Attack Bonus: The battle sorcerer uses the base attack bonus progression of the cleric.

Class Skills
Remove Bluff from the battle sorcerer''s class skill list. Add Intimidate to the battle sorcerer''s class skill list.

Class Features
The battle sorcerer has all the standard sorcerer class features, except as noted below.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: At 1st level, a battle sorcerer gains proficiency with any light or one-handed martial weapon of the character''s choice. She also gains proficiency with light armor.

Spellcasting: A battle sorcerer can cast sorcerer spells derived from her class levels of battle sorcerer while in light armor without the normal arcane spell failure chance.

A battle sorcerer has fewer daily spell slots than a standard sorcerer. Subtract one spell per day from each spell level on Table: The Sorcerer (to a minimum of zero spells per day). For example, a 1st-level battle sorcerer may cast four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells per day (plus bonus spells, if any).

A battle sorcerer knows fewer spells per spell level than a standard sorcerer. Subtract one spell known from each spell level on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known (to a minimum of one spell per spell level). For example, a 4th-level battle sorcerer knows five 0-level spells, two 1st-level spells, and one 2nd-level spell. When she reaches 5th level, the battle sorcerer learns one additional 1st-level spell, but doesn''t learn an additional 2nd-level spell (since two minus one is one).

Beleaguered Spellcaster
The most fragile of all archetypes, arcane spellcasters struggle to avoid taking damage as often as possible. As injuries accumulate your desperation causes your spells to become more effective.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Whenever you take an amount of damage equal to 3 times your spellcaster level from one attack, the next spell you cast is automatically maximized or extended (your choice) without increasing the spell level or casting time.

You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + the spellcasting ability score modifier of the class in which you took this alternative class feature.

Blood of Eberron
You possess a deep bond to Eberron, the Dragon Between, which shapes your sorcerous powers. Myths call Eberron the mother of all natural creatures, giving you a deep bond to the world of nature.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the normal list of class skills, nor do you gain a familiar.

Benefit: The following are your sorcerer class skills: Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Heal, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (nature), Profession, Spellcraft.

In addition, you gain an animal companion, as a druid of half your sorcerer level. Your druid, ranger, and sorcerer levels stack to determine the abilities of your animal companion. If you possess the Natural Spell feat, its benefits apply any time that you are in the form of an animal, whether due to wild shape, polymorph, or other magical effects.

Blood of Khyber
You possess a deep bond to Khyber, the Dragon Below, which shapes your sorcerous powers. Your bond with the darkness increases your ability to conjure fiendish creatures and work spells of transmutation.

Level: 1st.

Replace: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the normal list of class skills, nor do you gain a familiar.

Benefit: The following are your sorcerer class skills: Bluff, Concentration, Craft, Intimidate, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (dungeoneering), Profession, Spellcraft.

Your caster level increases by 1 whenever you cast spells from the schools of conjuration (summoning) or transmutation. You cannot summon any creature of good alignment. In addition, your caster level decreases by 1 (minimum CL 1st) whenever you cast spells from the schools of abjuration or divination.

Blood of Siberys
You possess a deep bond to Siberys, the Dragon Above, which shapes your sorcerous powers. Many believe the Dragon Above is the source of all arcane magic, and the first dragons were born from the blood that fell when Khyber slew Siberys. Your bond to the Dragon Above enhances your ability to channel magic.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain the normal list of class skills, nor do you gain a familiar.

Benefit: The following are your sorcerer class skills: Bluff, Concentration, Craft, Diplomacy, Knowledge (arcana), Knowledge (the planes), Profession, Spellcraft.

In addition, you add +4 to your effective Charisma for purposes of determining bonus sorcerer spells and the maximum level of spell you can cast. For example, even if your natural Charisma is 14, you can still cast up to 8th-level sorcerer spells. This bonus does not affect saving throw DCs, skill rolls, or provide any of the other benefits dependant on Charisma.

Dead Levels
The sorcerer, similar to the cleric, has nineteen dead levels. The sorcerer parts from the cleric, however, in that new spells known are gained at every level (which can be considered special abilities in their own right). Still, a prestige class that grants +1 level of spellcasting and special abilities at every level makes a minor dead level ability infinitely possible.

Magical Affinity (Ex): Starting at 2nd level, a sorcerer can identify a certain creature type during an encounter by virtue of inheriting his magical ability from a member of that creature type. The type must include at least one creature with an arcane spell-like ability (such as dragon, magical beast, or outsider). Once this choice is made, it cannot be reversed. The sorcerer gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks to identify such creature types, but he gains no insight about their special powers or vulnerabilities. See Knowledge. Moreover, the sorcerer can make these Knowledge (arcana) checks untrained. This bonus increases by +1 for each sorcerer level the character takes after 2nd level.

Disciple of Boccob
As a deeply loyal and pious student of Boccob the Uncaring, you know the secret to creating powerful magic items through your understanding of the Archmage of the Deities'' teachings.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: You qualify for item creation feats as a character 1 level higher. Magic items you create are crafted at +1 caster level. The item gains this bonus for free; you do not pay the extra cost associated with a higher caster level. If you destroy a permanent magic item you lose all arcane spellcasting abilities for a day per caster level of the item.

Divine Companion
By sacrificing a possible link to an earthly creature, you gain the ability to store arcane energy in a divine reservoir that takes the form of a spirit creature. Linked to you through your own life essence, this divine companion can then transform that energy into beneficial effects.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the summon familiar class feature.

Benefit: You can spend 100 gp to perform a ritual dedicated to the deity of your choice and summon forth a spirit creature to aid you in your adventures. This creature is both invisible and intangible, but it provides you with real benefits.

The divine companion stores arcane energy and redirects it to you according to your level and your needs. To fill this reservoir, you must cast one or more targeted spells at this creature. A spell so cast does not produce its normal effect; the companion simply absorbs the spell''s energy. It can store a number of spell levels equal to your arcane caster level. You can cast spells into it at any time, but after you rest and recover your spell slots for the day, the divine companion loses any stored energy.

The divine companion exists outside reality and cannot be affected by spells, spell-like abilities, or any sort of antimagic effect or dispel check. It cannot, however, release its arcane energy within an antimagk field or similar effect. It uses your caster level for any checks required, and when it releases arcane energy, the level of the effect created equals the number of spell levels released.

The divine companion can release its stored spell energy in either of the following ways, at your command. You can use each effect as often as you wish, until the companion''s stored energy is depleted.

Healing (Su): As a standard action, you can order your divine companion to convert the energy it has stored into healing power. This is the equivalent of a conjuration (healing) spell. This effect heals you for 1d6 points of damage per stored spell level, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored).

Shielding (Su): As a swift action, you can order the creature to convert the energy it has stored into protecting you. This is the equivalent of an abjuration spell that provides you with a deflection bonus to AC and a resistance bonus on saves each equal to the number of stored spell levels, or as many levels as you designate (up to the maximum currently stored). This effect lasts for 1 round per arcane caster level you possess.

Domain Access
Your depth of belief allows you to channel divine power the way a cleric does. By doing so, you gain access to a single cleric domain.

Level: 5th.

Replaces: To gain this benefit, you do not learn a new 1st-level sorcerer spell and a new 2nd-level sorcerer spell at 5th level. From now on, you know one less sorcerer spell that you can cast at each subsequent level (not counting the domain spells from this alternative class feature).

Benefit: Choose one cleric domain. If you worship a specific deity, the domain you choose must be one to which your deity grants access. You gain the granted power of the chosen domain. In addition, you can cast one domain spell of each spell level available to you per day from that domain.

Draconic Ray
The silver-haired ice mage and the black-eyed scoundrel with a knack for corrosive spells belong to a unique breed of sorcerers. Their personalities, physical traits, and the spells at which they excel reflect their draconic heritages.

These sorcerers explore the roots of sorcery and develop alternative class features based on the nature of their draconic ancestors. If the sorcerer gains draconic ray, he must choose a specific ancestral dragon kind from among the various breeds of chromatic and metallic dragons. The sorcerer must select his ancestral dragon kind when he acquires his first level in sorcerer. Once chosen, he may not change it later. A sorcerer who selects this alternative class feature permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar. Since this is an optional rule, you must check with your DM before selecting draconic ray in place of a familiar.

If you take draconic ray and the Draconic Heritage feat, you must choose the same dragon kind for both.

Draconic Ray (Su): The sorcerer can, once per day, fire a ray as a spell-like ability. Using this ray requires a successful ranged touch attack. A creature struck by such a ray takes 1d4 points of damage + 1 per sorcerer level of an energy type appropriate to the sorcerer''s chosen dragon ancestor kind. In addition, the creature struck by the ray must make a saving throw of the appropriate type (DC 10 + 1 per 2 sorcerer levels + Charisma modifier) or also be affected by the ray''s secondary effect. Each ray has a range of 25 feet + 5 feet per 2 sorcerer levels. The type of energy damage dealt and the ray''s secondary effect depends on the chosen ancestor dragon. The caster level for secondary effects equals half the character''s sorcerer levels.

Ancestor
Dragon	Energy
Type	Secondary
Effect	Saving
Throw
Black	Acid	Shadow eyes	Will
Blue	Electricity	Dehydration	Fortitude
Green	Acid	Command	Will
Red	Fire	Burning	Reflex
White	Cold	Rime of ice	Reflex
Brass	Fire	Sleep	Will
Bronze	Electricity	Fear	Will
Copper	Acid	Slow	Fortitude
Gold	Fire	Weakening	Fortitude
Silver	Cold	Hold Person	Will
Burning: The target catches on fire unless it succeeds at a Reflex save. This deals 1d4 points of damage per round for 1 round per 2 sorcerer levels.

Command: The target is affected by the command spell unless it succeeds at a Will save.

Dehydration: The target is dehydrated and must succeed at a Fort save or take an additional 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 2 sorcerer levels.

Fear: The target becomes panicked for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save.

Hold Person: The target is held, as hold person, for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save.

Rime of Ice: The target is covered in a rime of ice that lasts 1 round. If the target fails on a Reflex save it drops whatever it is holding and falls prone.

Shadow Eyes: Shadows shroud the target''s eyes for 1d6 rounds, causing everything to have concealment in relation to the target (a 20% miss chance). Creatures with blindsight or other abilities to perceive their surroundings without using their eyes can ignore this effect.

Sleep: The target falls asleep for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will save.

Slow: The target is slowed for 1d6 rounds unless it succeeds at a Fortitude save.

Weakening: The target takes a 1d4 penalty to Strength unless it succeeds at a Fort save. This penalty lasts for 1 round per two sorcerer levels of the sorcerer.

Dragonblood Sorcerer
Kobolds, spellscales, and the members of other dragonblood races tap into their innate draconic talents to achieve greater heights of sorcerous power. Forgoing any pretense of mundane pursuits, a dragonblood sorcerer explores new approaches to casting arcane spells.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a dragonblood sorcerer substitution level, a character must have the dragonblood subtype and be about to take his 1st, 4th, or 7th level of sorcerer.

Class Skills
Dragonblood sorcerer substitution levels have the class skills of the standard sorcerer class, minus Craft and Profession, plus Use Magic Device. In addition, a dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level gains a class skill from his Draconic Heritage feat.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

4th	+2	+1	+1	+4	Arcane insight +4, spell-like ability	See text
7th	+3	+2	+2	+5	Arcane insight +6, bonus spells known	See text
Class Features
All the following are class features of the dragonblood sorcerer racial substitution levels.

Arcane Insight (Ex): A 1st-level dragonblood sorcerer''s racial talent with magic grants him keen insights into arcane mysteries. Each time he selects a dragonblood sorcerer substitution level, he gains a cumulative +2 insight bonus on Knowledge (arcana) checks.

Draconic Heritage: A 1st-level dragonblood sorcerer gains Draconic Heritage as a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer''s familiar class feature.

Spell-Like Ability: A dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 4th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to transform a sorcerer spell he knows into a spell-like ability. A spell chosen for this ability can''t have a costly material component, an XP cost, or any sort of focus, and it can''t be a spell of the highest level the sorcerer can cast. The chosen spell is removed from the sorcerer''s list of spells known, reducing his number of known spells of that level by one, and the sorcerer loses one spell slot of that spell level - as well as one spell slot from the next higher level of spells he is able to cast. In return for those two spell slots, he gains the ability to use the chosen spell as a spell-like ability three times per day, using his sorcerer level as the caster level.

Each time a dragonblood sorcerer who has this substitution level feature gains access to a new spell level, he can exchange the spell chosen for this ability for a new one. He returns the previously chosen spell to his list of spells known and regains both lost spell slots. He then chooses a new spell, subject to the limitations given above. He loses that spell from his spells known list along with one spell slot of the newly chosen spell''s level and a spell slot one level higher than the chosen spell.

Bonus Spells Known: A dragonblood sorcerer who takes the 7th-level racial substitution level adds four spells to his list of known sorcerer spells. The spells added depend on the dragonblood sorcerer''s alignment or draconic heritage.

A dragonblood sorcerer who is good-aligned must choose the good list of known spells, and vice versa. One descended from a particular kind of dragon is treated as if he shared that dragon''s alignment for the purpose of this substitution feature, regardless of his own alignment. For example, a half-red dragon sorcerer, or a sorcerer with Draconic Heritage (red dragon), is treated as evil-aligned for determining which bonus spells known he gains. Dragonblood sorcerers who are neither good nor evil and have no distinct draconic heritage can choose which set of spells to add.

If a dragonblood sorcerer already knows any of the listed spells, he can pick another spell that a sorcerer would ordinarily have available at that same level.

Evil: 1st - charm person; 2nd - darkness, resist energy; 3rd - suggestion.

Good: 1st - bless; 2nd - fog cloud, resist energy; 3rd - fly.

The chosen list of spells known replaces the normal additions to the sorcerer''s list of spells known (one 1st-level spell, one 2nd-level spell, one 3rd-level spell) gained at 7th level.

Drakken Familiar
Arcane spellcasters, even those who don''t claim the blood of dragons as their own, often have a special link with dragonkind. One manifestation of this link is the caster''s familiar, which can take on draconic characteristics.

Class: Hexblade, sorcerer, or wizard.

Level: 4th (hexblade) or 1st (sorcerer or wizard).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, your familiar does not gain all the benefits normally accorded to a familiar. See below to determine which alternative benefits it gains, and which standard benefits these replace.

Benefit: Your familiar is a drakken version of a normal animal. It gains the dragonblood subtype and all the benefits of being a familiar, except as described below.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to deliver touch spells, it gains a breath weapon instead. This breath is a 15-foot cone of fire, usable once per hour, that deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + twice your class level (levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for this purpose). A successful Reflex save (10 + 1/2 your total class levels for determining the familiar''s abilities) halves the damage dealt.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to speak with animals of its kind, it instead gains the ability to speak with creatures of the dragon type.

Dwarf Sorcerer
In most dwarf communities, sorcerers are relatively rare. Dwarves don''t tend to have the force of personality required for top-notch sorcerers; thus they often prefer wizardry instead. However, a dwarf sorcerer can tap into other reservoirs of power - including the very earth itself - to enhance his arcane aptitude. To do this, he gives up some of his versatility, but the power gained is substantial.

Hit Die: d6.

Requirements
To take a dwarf sorcerer substitution level, a character must be a dwarf about to take his 1st, 5th, or 9th level of sorcerer.

Class Skills
Dwarf sorcerer substitution levels have the class skills of the standard sorcerer class plus Knowledge (dungeoneering) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

9th	+4	+3	+3	+6	Earth meditation	See text
Class Features
All the following are features of the dwarf sorcerer''s racial substitution levels.

Arcane Earthbond (Su): A dwarf sorcerer who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level can draw power and support from an arcane bond he forges with the earth. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magic materials that cost 100 gp.

The arcane earthbond ability grants a dwarf sorcerer the Alertness feat whenever he is in contact with the ground. He also enjoys damage reduction 1/adamantine when in contact with the ground.

This benefit replaces the standard sorcerer''s ability to gain a familiar. If the dwarf gains a familiar from another class (such as wizard), his sorcerer levels don''t stack to determine the familiar''s abilities.

Power of Stone (Su): A dwarf sorcerer who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level learns to channel his spell power through the earth. As long as both he and his target are touching the ground, the range of any spell he casts that targets or affects that creature or object is increased by 50%, and the save DC for the spell increases by 1. If the spell targets multiple creatures or objects, all the targets must be touching the ground for the sorcerer to gain the benefits of this ability.

This benefit replaces the standard sorcerer''s ability to learn a new 2nd-level spell at 5th level. From now on, the dwarf sorcerer''s number of 2nd-level spells known is one fewer than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

Earth Meditation (Ex): A dwarf sorcerer who takes the 9th-level racial substitution level learns to focus his meditations on the quiet power of the earth beneath him. If the dwarf sorcerer spends his 8 hours of rest and 15 minutes of concentration to prepare spells while in contact with the ground, he can add his Constitution bonus (if any) to his Charisma score to determine his bonus sorcerer spell slots.

This benefit replaces the standard sorcerer''s ability to learn a new 4th-level spell at 9th level. From now on, the dwarf sorcerer''s number of 4th-level spells known is one fewer than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

Focus Caster
A familiar offers companionship and, when necessary, an effective scout or spy. It does little for your spellcasting, however. This option presents you with a less generally useful item that instead enhances your spellcasting in some way.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Instead of a familiar, you bind yourself to a masterwork item that acts as a focus for all your spells and that enhances the power of spells of one school. Once you have a masterwork item to bind to, you must perform a ritual that requires 24 hours and reagents costing 100 gp, much as if you were summoning a familiar.

When casting any spell, you must hold, wield, or wear this item (as appropriate), in addition to providing the normal components of the spell (even other foci). Your focus item is used in addition to the spell''s normal components, not instead of. You are automatically considered proficient with your focus item, but you do not gain proficiency with any other item (weapon or armor) of the same type. For example, if your focus item is a longsword, you are proficient with your focus longsword but not with any other longsword, unless of course another feat or class feature grants you proficiency. When you cast a spell from the school to which your focus belongs, that spell is enhanced. At 7th and 15th levels, your focus grants additional abilities.

You may have only one focus item at a time. A specialist wizard may select only the focus appropriate to her specialty school. Bonuses gained from a focus item stack with similar bonuses gained from feats such as Spell Focus or Spell Penetration.

Your focus item grows tougher as you advance in level. The hardness of your focus item increases by one-half your caster level, up to double its normal hardness. In addition, your focus item gains additional hit points equal to your caster level, up to double its normal number of hit points. These bonuses are in addition to any increase in hardness or hit points the item gains for being made into a magic item.

If your focus item can be enhanced with magic, it costs you less XP to do so. When determining your XP cost for making your focus item into a magic item (or for upgrading it later), reduce the base cost by 10%. This reduction stacks with any other reduction you might gain, such as from the Legendary Artisan feat. Another character enhancing your focus item does not gain this reduction in XP cost.

If your focus item is destroyed, you must bind yourself to another masterwork item. You cannot bind to an item that is already a magic item. You can only bind to masterwork items. The item can be made of special materials (such as adamantine, cold iron, or darkwood).

The following items are typical foci for each of the standard schools.

Abjuration: Usually a set of bracers, a buckler, or a small shield (wooden or steel), your focus grants any nonpersonal abjuration spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, you may cast any personal abjuration spell as a touch spell.

Conjuration: Usually a gnarled and twisted quarterstaff or other polearm, your focus increases the duration of any conjuration spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 3 rounds.

Divination: Usually a large crystal (loose or mounted on a rod or staff) or ornate holy symbol, your focus increases the caster level of any divination spell you cast by +1. At 7th level, the duration of any divination spell you cast doubles. At 15th level, you gain a bonus to resist divinations equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).

Enchantment: Usually an ornate and typically nonfunctional piece of clothing, such as a sash or a hair ribbon, your focus increases the duration of any enchantment spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the DC of your enchantment spells increases by +2.

Evocation: Usually a bladed weapon, such as a longsword or dagger, your focus grants +1 point of damage to any evocation spell you cast. Non-area effect spells that allow multiple targets (such as magic missile) only deal the bonus damage to a single target of your choice. For example, a fireball spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer with this focus deals 6d6+1 points of damage to all creatures caught within it, while a magic missile spell cast by the same sorcerer creates three missiles: two that deal 1d4+1 points of damage and one that deals 1d4+2 points of damage. At 7th level, evocation spells you cast ignore the first 5 points of any energy or elemental resistances that a creature may have. Immunities are not affected. At 15th level, you may, once per day, ignore a creature''s immunity when you cast an evocation spell that affects it.

Illusion: Usually a mask, shroud, cloak, or similar concealing piece of clothing, your focus increases the caster level of illusion spells you cast by +1. At 7th level, for every illusion spell you cast you gain a bonus on caster level checks made to defeat spell resistance equal to half your caster level. At 15th level, you may cast any personal illusion spell as a touch spell.

Necromancy: Usually a flail, kama, sickle, scythe, or other weapon derived from harvesting crops, your focus increases the range of any necromancy spell you cast by +25%. At 7th level, any necromancy spell you cast that deals ability damage, ability drain, or directly assigns a penally to an ability score deals +1 point of ability damage or ability drain or increases the penalty by an additional -1. For example, a 12th-level necromancer who casts ray of enfeeblement bestows a Strength penalty of 1d6+6 instead of the normal 1d6+5. At 15th level, any living creature affected by a necromancy spell you cast and fails the Fortitude save against it also becomes fatigued.

Transmutation: Usually a piece of equipment or set of tools used to create something (such as thieves'' tools, a musical instrument, or artisan''s tools), your focus grants any nonpersonal transmutation spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, once per day, a transmutation spell you cast that grants a bonus to ability scores doubles the bonus. For example, a bull''s strength spell grants a +8 bonus to Strength instead of the normal +4.

Githyanki Sorcerer
As arcane spellcasters, sorcerers belong to the warlock caste. Though sorcerers fill the same role as wizards, the githyanki view them as a completely different kind of spellcaster. As a society that pays careful attention to function and performance, the githyanki recognize the flexibility of sorcerers'' casting as a great advantage, while likewise recognizing the severe limitations of their constrained spell selection. Unlike most other races, the githyanki rarely send a sorcerer to do a wizard''s job, or vice versa. They value sorcerers for combat-heavy missions, where the best tactic is likely to involve blasting the enemy with lightning bolt after lightning bolt.

Like sorcerers among other races, githyanki sorcerers trace their power to dragon ancestry; specifically, to the same interbreeding of githyanki and fiendish red dragons that produced the first duthka''gith. Githyanki sorcerers often manifest monstrous features, largely cosmetic, reminiscent of their infernal draconic heritage.

Sorcerers who choose the path of the duthka''ariy manifest their draconic heritage as they advance levels, but they can never acquire a familiar. A sorcerer of the duthka''ariy gains the following benefits as he advances in level:

Sorcerer
Level	Duthka''ariy Abilities
1st–4th	Natural Weapons: The character gains the benefit of the Improved Unarmed Strike feat.
Keen Senses: The character gains the benefit of the Alertness feat.
5th–8th	Natural Armor: The character gains a natural armor bonus of +1.
9th–12th	Keen Senses: The character''s darkvision extends to 120 feet.
13th–16th	Fire Focus: The character casts fire spells at +1 caster level.
17th–20th	Fire Resistance: The character gains fire resistance 10.

Golarion Sorcerer
Some sorcerers raised on the Isle of Hermea do not call familiars like others from the mainland. They instead focus their development on harnessing their inner reserve of magic, for use in times of need. This ability replaces the summon familiar ability.

Hidden Reserve (Su): Starting at 1st level, a sorcerer with this ability can call upon a hidden reserve of magical energy to cast additional spells. This reserve can be used to cast any spell the sorcerer could normally cast, but the sorcerer is fatigued after the spell is completed. If this spell if of the highest level that the sorcerer could normally cast, the sorcerer is exhausted instead. This ability cannot be used while fatigued or exhausted. It can be used a number of times per day equal to the sorcerer''s Charisma bonus.

Imbued Staff
As an optional rule, any sorcerer or wizard may opt to forego a normal familiar in order to imbue her traveling staff with that portion of her power. To do this, she selects a quarterstaff-length of wood that resonates with her mystical signature and personality. It cannot have been previously enchanted (although it may subsequently be) and must be of masterwork quality. It must be prepared using materials costing at least 500 gp, usually with a gem to serve as a mounted finial. The imbuing ritual takes 24 hours and ties a portion of the spellcaster''s power into the staff, a separate piece of her soul that grows in power as she does. Upon its imbuing, the staff becomes magically linked to its creator and is treated as a magic item.

Hit Points: The staff has 10 Hit Points and Hardness 5, both of which increase as the wizard or sorcerer gains levels, according to the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

Saving Throws: The staff saves as its creator, even when unattended.

If an imbued staff is broken, its creator must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or lose 500 experience points per wizard or sorcerer level. Success reduces the loss by half. However, a caster''s experience point total can never be reduced below 0 as a result of the loss of her staff. A broken imbued staff cannot be replaced for a year and a day - the loss is too great.

If the character who imbued the staff dies, the staff loses all magical properties. Should the character return from the grave, it regains its imbued powers when it is first touched by the imbuing character.

Table: Imbued Staff Advancement

Master
Class Level	Hardness	Hit Points	Special
1st–2nd	5	15	Cantrips, deliver touch spells
3rd–4th	5	15	Enhanced weapon +1
5th–6th	5	15	Remote viewing
7th–8th	10	20	—
9th–10th	10	20	Vital Transfer
11th–12th	10	20	Enhanced weapon +2
13th–14th	15	25	Perfect location
15th–16th	15	25	Mighty weapon
17th–18th	15	25	Return
19th–20th	20	30	Enhanced weapon +3
Imbued Ability Descriptions
An imbued staff has special capabilities depending on its master''s wizard or sorcerer level, as shown on the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

Cantrips (Sp): Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder of the staff can make it shed a flickering light as per the spell. Once activated, this light remains until the wielder dismisses it (a free action). In addition, the staff can hold a single cantrip available to the wielder, decided upon when it is first imbued. Once per day, as a standard action, the master can cast this cantrip from the staff. The caster level for these effects is equal to that of the master. The save DC for any cantrip cast by the staff is 10.

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): The master may deliver touch spells with the staff. When using the staff in this way, the wielder may attempt to deal the staffs damage by hitting the target''s standard AC (as opposed to the target''s touch AC). A successful critical hit with the staff does not double the spell''s affect when delivered in this way.

Enhanced Weapon (Su): The staff gains the listed enhancement bonus to attack and damage when wielded by its master. This bonus applies to both ends of the staff. In the hands of any other it is merely an ordinary masterwork staff.

Remote Viewing (Su): The staff''s master may concentrate and view the staff''s surroundings as though looking through the finial. This effect is identical to that of clairvoyance except that it lasts for as long as the owner concentrates and has an infinite range so long as the staff is on the same plane. While in effect, the staff''s finial glows faintly, illuminating the area around the staff like a candle.

Vital Transfer (Su): The staff''s master may opt to forego her natural healing for the evening and mend her staff through mystical means. Each night''s rest thus spent returns a number of hit points to the staff equal to the master''s character level, up to the staff''s maximum hit points. The Heal skill does not increase this amount.

Perfect Location (Su): By concentrating for a full round, the wizard knows the direction and distance to her staff, so long as it is on the same plane.

Mighty Weapon (Su): The staff gains the bane, defending, flaming, frost, merciful, shock, or thundering special weapon ability. This ability applies to both ends of the staff. Once chosen, the bonus cannot be changed and does not function in the hands of anyone other than the staff''s master.

Return (Su): The master can summon the staff to her hand as a standard action, so long as it is on the same plane. When summoned in this way, the staff simply appears in its master''s hand. Any effect targeting the staff or the master that prevents teleportation also blocks this ability.

Invested Symbol of Power
Once a staff has been imbued with a wizard''s power, the spellcaster can further enhance it through feats like Enchant Staff, Imbued Defense, Imbued Strength, Invest Spell, and Recharge Staff. These feats each require further preparation and ornamentation of the staff, and as such are classified as item creation feats.

Enhancing an Imbued Staff
A wizard with the Craft Staff feat wishing to add powers to her imbued staff as if it were a normal staff may do so, however all costs associated with its creation are increased by 20%. This reflects the difficulty in overlaying the newer abilities with the existing powers. A staff crafted in this manner is created with 50 charges. It retains any imbued powers and its magical nature, even after the charges are expended.

Impromptu Metamagic
Sorcerers typically seek to maximize their limited spell selection by utilizing metamagic feats. Other arcane spellcasters also adjust their spells with these feats in order to keep their enemies guessing or to find added flexibility for their lower-level spells. This ability allows you to spontaneously apply metamagic feats to your spells.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Each day, you may choose a metamagic feat you have. You can cast spells affected by that feat without increasing the spell level or casting time of the spells. You may not use any other metamagic feats that day. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 5 minus the level adjustment of the metamagic feat. (Thus, you may use Quicken Spell in this way once per day, while you could use Silent Spell four times per day.)

You may apply the metamagic feat spontaneously, as you cast the spell. If you prepare spells, you do not need to prepare the spells with the metamagic feat already applied.

Even though this ability does not increase the spell''s level, you must be able to cast spells of the level the spell would be if you applied the metamagic feat normally. For example, a quickened magic missile would normally require a 5th-level spell slot. With this ability you may cast a quickened magic missile as a 1st-level spell, but you must still be able to cast 5th-level spells.


Metamagic Specialist
With a limited selection of spells at his fingertips, it''s natural for a sorcerer to turn to metamagic feats to gain flexibility in effects. If the idea of playing a sorcerer who efficiently twists his spells into new shapes and sizes excites you, the metamagic specialist alternative class feature is the way to go. Though you must forgo the benefits of a familiar to pursue this path, some sorcerers relish not having to keep track of such a vulnerable accessory.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: You can apply metamagic feats that you know to sorcerer spells without increasing the casting time. This benefit even lets you quicken your sorcerer spells with the Quicken Spell feat.

You can use this class feature a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Int modifier (minimum 1). This is an extraordinary ability.

Planar Sorcerer
Though many claim a sorcerer''s power derives from draconic heritage, a few sorcerers believe that their arcane prowess comes from an even purer source - the planes themselves. It isn''t uncommon to see sorcerers traveling the multiverse in search of support for this belief.

Unlike other spellcasters, the sorcerer has a limited ability to customize his talents for planar adventuring. With a small list of spells known, the sorcerer who wishes to adapt to life on the planes must choose his tools wisely. Even so, the wide variety of challenges awaiting the planar sorcerer demands a slightly more adaptable approach to spellcasting.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a sorcerer planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 5th, 9th, or 13th level of sorcerer.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Sorcerer planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard sorcerer class plus Knowledge (the planes) (Int).

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
5th	+2	+1	+1	+4	Force-charged energy	See text
9th	+4	+3	+3	+6	Extraplanar spell penetration	See text
13th	+6/+1	+4	+4	+8	Spontaneous planar summoning	See text
Class Features
All of the following are features of the sorcerer''s planar substitution levels.

Force-Charged Energy (Su): At 5th level, a planar sorcerer can lace his spells with pure force, the better to affect the various energy-resistant elementals and outsiders he faces. At the sorcerer''s option, half of the energy damage dealt by a spell he casts is replaced by force damage. This effect can be applied to any spell that deals acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage.

The maximum spell level to which a planar sorcerer can apply this effect is one lower than the highest level of sorcerer spell that he can cast. For instance, a 5th-level planar sorcerer can apply this effect to 0-level and 1st-level sorcerer spells, while an 18th-level planar sorcerer can apply it to spells of up to 8th level.

This benefit replaces the ability to learn a new 2nd-level spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 5th level. From now on, the sorcerer''s number of 2nd-level spells known at any class level is one less than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

Extraplanar Spell Penetration (Ex): A 9th-level planar sorcerer can imbue his spells with the ability to penetrate the spell resistance of extraplanar creatures more readily. Three times per day, for 1 round each time, the sorcerer can add his Charisma bonus to all his caster level checks made to overcome the spell resistance of extraplanar creatures.

This benefit replaces the ability to learn a new 4th-level spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 9th level. From now on, the sorcerer''s number of 4th-level spells known at any class level is one less than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

Spontaneous Planar Summoning (Su): A 13th-level planar sorcerer learns to summon extraplanar creatures spontaneously. When he chooses this planar substitution benefit, a sorcerer selects one of the following categories: elementals (creatures of the elemental type), celestial creatures (creatures with the celestial template), or fiendish creatures (creatures with the fiendish template). He can use any spell slot to spontaneously cast a summon monster spell of the same level, but he can use that spell to summon only creatures of the selected category.

For example, a 13th-level sorcerer who chose elementals could use one of his 6th-level spell slots to cast summon monster VI. He could use that spell to summon a single Large elemental, or 1d3 Medium elementals (from the 5th-level summoning list). He could not use the spell to summon creatures that weren''t elementals.

This benefit replaces the ability to learn a new 6th-level spell gained by a standard sorcerer at 13th level. From now on, the sorcerer''s number of 6th-level spells known at any class level is one less than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

Poltergeists
The magic lives inside sorcerers. It emerges in sparkling motes of power or dazzling bursts of energy that both terrify and delight. For the child destined to become a sorcerer magical outbursts promise greater things to come. Long before they learn to control their power would-be sorcerers plague their households with the unexpected and the unexplained. Called poltergeists ("noisy ghosts") by some scholars, this untamed magic leaves many parents fearful of restless spirits.

Sometimes a sorcerer never learns to fully control these first flashes of mystical energy and manifests his poltergeists even as an adult. Such a sorcerer lacks some of the flexibility of his comrades but gains unique abilities in exchange. A sorcerer character must choose to have a poltergeist at 1st level and must give up two 0-level spells. These lost spells mean the poltergeist-plagued sorcerer begins play with just three 0-level spells instead of five. In addition, the chosen spells cannot later be learned by the sorcerer. In a sense, the sorcerer has access to the chosen spells but they manifest in a different way. The exact nature and effect of a given poltergeist depends upon the spells that underpin it. The poltergeists shown here are merely the most common. Many others exist.

Crawling Coins (Su): Your first word likely being "Mine," your loathing of sharing somehow gives life to small objects on your person, sending them scuttling away from those hoping to take them from you. You may use Sleight of Hand to conceal objects on your body even if you put no skill ranks in it. Further, anyone attempting to use Sleight of Hand to take something from you suffers a -4 penalty.

Spells lost: Prestidigitation and open/close.

Fanfare (Su): Perhaps coddled a bit too much as a child, you feel a sense of uniqueness and entitlement that causes you to enter rooms amidst a flourish of glorious sounds and pyrotechnics. You may, as a conscious act of will similar to holding your breath, suppress this ability, allowing you to sneak into a room. Doing so, however, leaves you feeling strangely diminished. When you permit this ability to function normally you gain a +2 bonus on Diplomacy or Intimidate checks for an hour against anyone who witnesses your spectacular entrance.

Spells lost: Dancing lights and ghost sounds.

Frost Fingers (Su): Often belabored for your clumsiness as a child, it sometimes seems as if your merest touch causes objects to shatter and crack. Whenever you first touch an object with a hardness of 2 or less it must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Charisma modifier) or take damage equal to your Charisma modifier. This damage ignores hardness. If the item makes its saving throw or endures the damage you may handle it normally thereafter.

Spells lost: Ray of frost and touch of fatigue.

That''ll Leave a Mark! (Su): Called a bully by many, the secret satisfaction you gained from making playmates cry "uncle" somehow caused you to leave a record of their submission visible to all. Whenever you successfully strike an opponent with an unarmed attack or touch attack she must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + Charisma modifier) or develop a bruise in a shape you desire in the area you struck. This bruise heals normally in a week and is removed by any amount of magical healing.

Spells lost: Acid splash and arcane mark.

The Pinch (Su): A solitary and eccentric child, often targeted by bullies with rocks or rotted food, you developed a minor but effective way of distracting your tormentors. Once per day as a standard action you can target a spellcaster concentrating on a spell and force the spellcaster to succeed at a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level of spell being concentrated on) or lose the spell. This disrupting effect cannot be used on a spell as it is being cast.

Spells lost: Flare and mage hand.

Raptoran Sorcerer
The raptoran sorcerer has an almost instinctive command of the magical forces required to manipulate the air beneath his wings. He loses some versatility in spellcasting but gains the ability to cast additional air-based spells and even the service of an elemental familiar.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a raptoran sorcerer substitution level, a character must be a raptoran about to take his 1st, 5th, or 11th level of sorcerer.

Class Skills
Raptoran sorcerer substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard sorcerer class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Raptoran Sorcerer Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+0	+0	+0	+2	Air magic, elemental familiar	Same as sorcerer
5th	+2	+1	+1	+4	Air magic, command the winds	See text
11th	+5	+3	+3	+7	Air magic, spell on the wing	See text
Class Features
All the following are features of the raptoran sorcerer''s racial substitution levels.

Air Magic: The following spells are considered to be on a raptoran sorcerer''s class spell list (and thus may be selected as known spells at the appropriate levels):

4th level: Air walk.

5th level: Control winds.

7th level: Wind walk.

8th level: Whirlwind.

A raptoran sorcerer gains this class feature if he selects any of the indicated raptoran sorcerer substitution levels (1st, 5th, or 11th).

Elemental Familiar (Ex): A 1st-level raptoran sorcerer can obtain a Small air elemental as a familiar. The elemental''s hit points are equal to its normal hit points or one half its master''s hit points, whichever are greater. The elemental familiar does not gain the ability to speak with animals. This familiar otherwise functions identically to the standard sorcerer''s familiar ability.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer''s familiar ability gained at 1st level.

Command the Winds: A 5th-level raptoran sorcerer adds gust of wind, whispering wind, and wind wall to his list of spells known. Wind wall is henceforth treated as a 2nd-level spell for the raptoran sorcerer.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer''s ability to learn a new 2nd-level spell at 5th level. From this point on, the raptoran sorcerer''s number of 2nd-level spells known (not including the gust of wind, whispering wind, and wind wall spells) is one less than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

Spell on the Wing (Ex): When airborne and casting a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less, a raptoran sorcerer of 11th level or higher can move both before and after spellcasting, provided that his total distance moved is not greater than his speed.

This substitution feature replaces the standard sorcerer''s ability to learn a new 5th-level spell at 11th level. From this point on, the raptoran sorcerer''s number of 5th-level spells known is one less than the value shown on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known.

School Mastery
Some specialist wizards take their mastery to whole new levels. Occasionally, even sorcerers and other arcane spellcasters focus their attentions on one school over the others. Your expertise in a chosen school of magic is unparalleled.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Choose a school of magic. If you are already a specialist wizard, you may only choose the school in which you are specialized. You cast all spells from the chosen school at +1 caster level. In addition, you gain the following benefit, based on the school you select.

Abjuration: Any non-instantaneous, nonpermanent abjuration spell you cast on someone other than yourself that does not require concentration has double the duration. You cannot use this ability on any spell whose duration you affect in any other way, such as with the Extend Spell metamagic feat.

Conjuration: Each creature you conjure with any summon spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Wisdom for the duration of the spell that summoned it.

Divination: Whenever you cast a divination spell, you immediately gain a +2 insight bonus on Listen and Spot skill checks for 1 hour per level of the spell you cast (0-level spells grant the bonus for 30 minutes).

Enchantment: For 24 hours after an enchantment spell you cast expires, the target of your spell takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made to resist your spells or spell-like abilities. You may affect only one creature at a time in this way. If your enchantment spell affected multiple targets, you must choose one creature against whom the penalty applies. Whenever an enchantment spell you cast expires while such a penally is active, the old penalty immediately disappears.

Evocation: Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, that spell deals +1 point of damage.

Illusion: Whenever you cast an illusion (shadow) spell that creates a partially real effect (such as shadow conjuration or shadow evocation), the effect is 10% more real than normal. Thus, a creature created by shadow conjuration is 30% as strong as a real creature of the same kind, instead of the normal 20%.

Necromancy: Each undead creature you create with any evil spell gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level. These temporary hit points last indefinitely, only disappearing when your creation takes damage. They cannot be regained once lost.

Transmutation: Whenever you cast a spell that alters a creature''s form, kind, or type, the DC to resist the spell increases by +1.

Sorcerer Spheres
Some sorcerers have figured out how to tap deeper into the power of their magical ancestors, gaining access to spheres or power over which those ancestors controlled. Specialist sorcerers have themes, referred to among arcane scholars as spheres.

A sphere represents an area with which you have an easier time focusing your arcane energies. Your sphere is the result of a powerful magical creature as an ancestor. You must choose your sphere at 1st level, and you may not change your sphere once you select it nor may you get rid of your sphere in order to become a general sorcerer. You cast all spells from your sphere at +1 caster level. This bonus does not apply to the use of spell trigger and spell completion items that use spells from your sphere.

Your sphere has an opposite, however, a type of magic in which your power is weaker. You cast all spells from your opposed sphere at -2 caster levels. Note that this penalty can delay your access to some spells. For example, if Aphrella has fire as her opposed sphere, she would need to wait until she was a 7th-level caster until she could cast fireball. In addition, you are unable to activate spell trigger and spell completion items from your opposed sphere.

Spheres should be narrower than spell schools, but not so narrow as to only affect a handful of spells. You and your DM should work together to determine what is fair for your campaign. When creating spheres and opposed spheres, the number of spells on each list should be roughly equal and of the same overall power. For example, while spells of the compulsion subschool might make a good sphere, spells of the charm subschool would make a poor opposed sphere since so few spells exist in that subschool. A spell might appear in multiple schools of magic.

EXAMPLE SPHERES
Presented here are five sample spheres which you can reverse for a total of ten useable spheres. For example, you can reverse the fire sphere to create the cold sphere. All spells with the cold descriptor belong to the cold sphere while all spells with the fire descriptor become your opposed sphere. Use these spheres as templates for creating your own.

Acid: An especially powerful black dragon is among your ancestors. Spells with the acid descriptor belong to your sphere. Spells with the electricity descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

Air: One of your ancestors was a djinni. Spells with the air descriptor belong to your sphere. Spells with the earth descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

Fire: A fire giant resides in your family tree. Spells with the fire descriptor belong to your sphere. Spells with the cold descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

Shadow: A powerful denizen of the Plane of Shadow is one of your relatives. Spells from the illusion (shadow) subschool belong to your sphere. Spells with the light descriptor make up your opposed sphere.

Summoning: A powerful conjurer resides in your family''s ancestry. Spells from the conjuration (summoning) subschool belong to your sphere. Spells from the conjuration (creation) make up your opposed sphere.

Spell Shield
As a powerful spellcaster, you''re likely to attract the attention of powerful opponents, and your teammates can''t always protect you. Spell shield lets you use your spells'' energy to offset damage that might otherwise kill you.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: By achieving oneness with the magical energy from which you draw your power, you make it part of your life force. As an immediate action when you take damage from any source, you can attempt to sacrifice spell energy instead of losing hit points. Expend a spell slot as if you had cast a spell of that level. Then, make a Concentration check with a DC equal to 15 + the level of the sacrificed spell. If you succeed, you ignore an amount of damage equal to five times the level of the spell slot you gave up. If you fail, you still lose the spell, but the magical energy fails to negate any of the damage.

For example, Hennet finds himself in the way of a black dragon''s breath. Although he succeeded on his saving throw, he is still going to take 22 points of acid damage. As a 7th-level sorcerer, Hennet can sacrifice a spell of up to 3rd level. He chooses a 3rd-level spell, so the DC of his Concentration check is 18. Hennet gets a result of 22 and magically negates 15 points of the acid damage, taking only 7 points.

You can attempt to deflect damage as often as you wish, but you can make only one attempt per round. If an attack''s damage has multiple sources (such as that of a flaming sword, which deals both weapon damage and fire damage), you must choose which source to negate. If an attack must deal damage to have a secondary effect (such as poison from a snake''s bite), negating all the damage also prevents the secondary effect.

Stalwart Sorcerer
Most sorcerers hide behind walls of steel, slinging spells at enemies safely distant. You have no patience for such cowards and prefer to be near the front line. Your breadth of magical knowledge might not compare with those craven weaklings, but you are proud to dive into the fray alongside the fighter.

Class: Sorcerer.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: Knowledge (arcana) 1 rank.

Replaces: Reduce by one the number of sorcerer spells known for your highest spell level (to a minimum of one). As a 1st-level character, you have one 1st-level spell known rather than two.

When you would gain a second known spell from a higher level, apply this penalty to the new spell level but remove it from the lower level. For example, at 5th level, you reduce your 2nd-level spells known from two to one but you gain the previously unavailable 1st-level spell (increasing your 1st-level spells known from three to four).

Benefit: You gain extra hit points equal to two times your sorcerer class level. Every time you advance a level, you gain another 2 extra hit points. (So, at 1st level you have 2 extra hit points, at 2nd level you have 4 extra hit points, and so on.)

You also gain the Martial Weapon Proficiency feat for a melee weapon of your choice, as well as Weapon Focus with that weapon.

Wilderness Companion
A sorcerer or wizard might desire a more durable companion to accompany him on excursions into the wilderness.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Familiar.

Gain: Animal companion (as druid; treat sorcerer or wizard as a druid of half his class level).

Witch
Below is a new spell list for a variant spellcasting class: the witch. A staple of fantasy literature and fairy tales, the witch dabbles in many kinds of magic - minor illusions, spells dealing with health or life, nature-based magic, simple divinations, and spells that alter the shape and appearance of things - but excels at just a few. Hence, her list is somewhat limited, but it contains wizard, cleric, and druid spells. She casts spells as a sorcerer, using the sorcerer''s Spells per Day table, and her spells are based on Charisma. The witch''s spell list is designed with the following considerations in mind.

Cure Spells: Only the weakest of these, and the witch doesn''t have the cleric''s ability to cast cure spells spontaneously. The witch isn''t blessed with a cleric''s (or druid''s) plethora of healing spells, but she can offer a little aid to those she favors.

Illusions: Only through the middle levels. A witch can trick her foes, but not to the extent that a wizard can.

Divinations: Only the straight-forward divinations, such as clairvoyance/clairaudience and scrying, and not even all of them.

Charms: Many. A major feature of this class.

Form-Changing: Another strong point for the witch. From alter self to shapechange, the witch has most of the spells relating to changing her (or someone else''s) form.

Nature: From speaking to animals to controlling the weather, the witch dabbles in this type of magic, if for no other reason than she usually lives a secluded life in the wilderness.

No Flashy Spells: Anything from a lightning bolt to a wall of fire to a Bigby''s hand spell is right out. The witch''s archetype doesn''t suggest overt attack spells or spells that create massive magic constructs. She doesn''t summon monsters, place wards, or teleport from place to place. Her magic is subtle.

Miscellaneous: Spells such as whispering wind, Leomund''s tiny hut, bestow curse (and a few other curse-like spells), and a few communication spells round out the list.

Witch Spell List
0 Level: arcane mark, cure minor wounds, dancing lights, daze, detect magic, detect poison, flare, ghost sound, light, mending, read magic, resistance, virtue.

1st Level: cause fear, change self, charm person, command, comprehend languages, cure light wounds, doom, endure elements, hypnotism, identify, silent image, sleep, speak with animals, ventriloquism.

2nd Level: alter self, blindness/deafness, calm emotions, cure moderate wounds, delay poison, detect thoughts, enthrall, invisibility, locate object, minor image, scare, whispering wind.

3rd Level: bestow curse, clairvoyance/clairaudience, contagion, create food and water, dispel magic, Leomund''s tiny hut, magic circle against chaos/law/evil/good*, major image, rage, remove blindness/deafness, suggestion, tongues.

4th Level: charm monster, crushing despair, discern lies, divination, fear, giant vermin, good hope, locate creature, minor creation, neutralize poison, polymorph, remove curse, scrying.

5th Level: baleful polymorph, dream, false vision, feeblemind, greater command, magic jar, major creation, mirage arcana, nightmare, seeming, sending.

6th Level: animate objects, control weather, eyebite, find the path, geas/quest, greater scrying, heroes'' feast, legend lore, mass suggestion, mislead, repulsion, shadow image, Tenser''s transformation, true seeing.

7th Level: creeping doom, finger of death, insanity, liveoak, repel wood, transport via plants.

8th Level: antipathy, demand, discern location, horrid wilting, polymorph any object, sympathy, trap the soul.

9th Level: earthquake, foresight, refuge, shapechange, wail of the banshee, weird.

* When she becomes able to cast 3rd-level spells, the witch chooses to have one of the four magic circle spells on her spell list. Whichever spell she chooses, she cannot cast it as a spell of an alignment opposed to her own.

    description = 'A few unintelligible words and fleeting gestures carry more power than a battleaxe, when they are the words and gestures of a wizard. These simple acts make magic seem easy, but they only hint at the time the wizard must spend poring over her spellbook preparing each spell for casting, and the years before that spent in apprenticeship to learn the arts of magic. Wizards depend on intensive study to create their magic. They examine musty old tomes, debate magical theory with their peers, and practice minor magics whenever they can. For a wizard, magic is not a talent but a difficult, rewarding art.

Wizards conduct their adventures with caution and forethought. When prepared, they can use their spells to devastating effect. When caught by surprise, they are vulnerable. They seek knowledge, power, and the resources to conduct their studies. They may also have any of the noble or ignoble motivations that other adventurers have.

The wizard''s strength is her spells. Everything else is secondary. She learns new spells as she experiments and grows in experience, and she can also learn them from other wizards. In addition to learning new spells, a wizard can, over time, learn to manipulate her spells so they go farther, work better, or are improved in some other way. Some wizards prefer to specialize in a certain type of magic. Specialization makes a wizard more powerful in her chosen field, but it denies her access to some of the spells that lie outside that field (see School Specialization). Like a sorcerer, a wizard can call a familiar - a small, magical animal companion that serves her. For some wizards, their familiars are their only true friends.

Overall, wizards show a slight tendency toward law over chaos because the study of magic rewards those who are disciplined. Illusionists and transmuters, however, are masters of deception and change, respectively. They favor chaos over law.

Wizards commonly revere Boccob (god of magic). Some, especially necromancers or simply more misanthropic wizards, prefer Wee Jas (goddess of death and magic). Evil necromancers are known to worship Nerull (god of death). Wizards in general are more devoted to their studies than to their spiritual sides.

Wizards recognize each other as comrades or rivals. Even wizards from very different cultures or magical traditions have much in common because they all conform to the same laws of magic. Unlike fighters or rogues, wizards see themselves as members of a distinct, if diverse, group. In civilized lands where wizards study in academies, schools, or guilds, wizards also identify themselves and others according to membership in these formal organizations. But while a guild magician may look down her nose at a rustic wizard who learned his arts from a doddering hermit, she nevertheless can''t deny the rustic''s identity as a wizard.

Humans take to magic for any of various reasons: curiosity, ambition, lust for power, or just personal inclination. Human wizards tend to be practical innovators, creating new spells or using old spells creatively. Elves are enthralled by magic, and many of them become wizards for love of the art. Elf wizards see themselves as artists, and they hold magic in high regard as a wondrous mystery, as opposed to the more pragmatic human wizards, who see magic more as a set of tools or tricks. Illusion magic comes so simply to gnomes that becoming an illusionist is just natural to brighter and more talented ones. Gnome wizards who don''t specialize in the school of illusion are rare, but they don''t suffer under any special stigma. Half-elf wizards feel both the elf''s attraction to magic and the human''s drive to conquer and understand. Some of the most powerful wizards are half-elves. Dwarf and halfling wizards are rare because their societies don''t encourage the study of magic. Half-orc wizards are rare because few half-orcs have the brains necessary for wizardry. Drow (evil, subterranean elves) often take up wizardry, but wizards are quite rare among the savage humanoids.

Wizards prefer to work with members of other classes. They love to cast their spells from behind strong fighters, to "magic up" rogues and send them out to scout, and to rely on the divine healing of clerics. They may find members of certain classes (such as sorcerers, rogues, and bards) to be not quite serious enough, but they''re not judgmental.

The wizard''s role depends somewhat on her spell selection, but most wizards share certain similarities in function. They are among the most offensively minded of the spellcasting classes, with a broad range of options available for neutralizing enemies. Some wizards provide great support to their comrades by way of their spells, while others may focus on divination or other facets of wizardry.

Alignment: Any.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Features
All of the following are class features of the wizard.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Wizards are proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a wizard''s movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.

Spells: A wizard casts arcane spells which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. A wizard must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time (see below).

To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, the wizard must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a wizard''s spell is 10 + the spell level + the wizard''s Intelligence modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a wizard can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: The Wizard. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.

Unlike a bard or sorcerer, a wizard may know any number of spells. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time by getting a good night''s sleep and spending 1 hour studying her spellbook. While studying, the wizard decides which spells to prepare.

Bonus Languages: A wizard may substitute Draconic for one of the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.

Familiar: A wizard can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a magical beast that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.

The wizard chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the wizard advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.

If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the wizard, the wizard must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw. Failure means he loses 200 experience points per wizard level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a wizard''s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar''s demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

Scribe Scroll: At 1st level, a wizard gains Scribe Scroll as a bonus feat.

Bonus Feats: At 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level, a wizard gains a bonus feat. At each such opportunity, she can choose a metamagic feat, an item creation feat, or Spell Mastery. The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat, including caster level minimums.

These bonus feats are in addition to the feat that a character of any class gets from advancing levels. The wizard is not limited to the categories of item creation feats, metamagic feats, or Spell Mastery when choosing these feats.

Spellbooks: A wizard must study her spellbook each day to prepare her spells. She cannot prepare any spell not recorded in her spellbook, except for read magic, which all wizards can prepare from memory.

A wizard begins play with a spellbook containing all 0-level wizard spells (except those from her prohibited school or schools, if any; see School Specialization, below) plus three 1st-level spells of your choice. For each point of Intelligence bonus the wizard has, the spellbook holds one additional 1st-level spell of your choice. At each new wizard level, she gains two new spells of any spell level or levels that she can cast (based on her new wizard level) for her spellbook. At any time, a wizard can also add spells found in other wizards'' spellbooks to her own.

SCHOOL SPECIALIZATION
A school is one of eight groupings of spells, each defined by a common theme. If desired, a wizard may specialize in one school of magic (see below). Specialization allows a wizard to cast extra spells from her chosen school, but she then never learns to cast spells from some other schools.

A specialist wizard can prepare one additional spell of her specialty school per spell level each day. She also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn the spells of her chosen school.

The wizard must choose whether to specialize and, if she does so, choose her specialty at 1st level. At this time, she must also give up two other schools of magic (unless she chooses to specialize in divination; see below), which become her prohibited schools. A wizard can never give up divination to fulfill this requirement. Spells of the prohibited school or schools are not available to the wizard, and she can''t even cast such spells from scrolls or fire them from wands. She may not change either her specialization or her prohibited schools later.

The eight schools of arcane magic are abjuration, conjuration, divination, enchantment, evocation, illusion, necromancy, and transmutation. Spells that do not fall into any of these schools are called universal spells.

Abjuration: Spells that protect, block, or banish. An abjuration specialist is called an abjurer.

Conjuration: Spells that bring creatures or materials to the caster. A conjuration specialist is called a conjurer.

Divination: Spells that reveal information. A divination specialist is called a diviner. Unlike the other specialists, a diviner must give up only one other school.

Enchantment: Spells that imbue the recipient with some property or grant the caster power over another being. An enchantment specialist is called an enchanter.

Evocation: Spells that manipulate energy or create something from nothing. An evocation specialist is called an evoker.

Illusion: Spells that alter perception or create false images. An illusion specialist is called an illusionist.

Necromancy: Spells that manipulate, create, or destroy life or life force. A necromancy specialist is called a necromancer.

Transmutation: Spells that transform the recipient physically or change its properties in a more subtle way. A transmutation specialist is called a transmuter.

Universal: Not a school, but a category for spells that all wizards can learn. A wizard cannot select universal as a specialty school or as a prohibited school. Only a limited number of spells fall into this category.

FAMILIARS
A familiar is a normal animal that gains new powers and becomes a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a magical beast instead of an animal for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master''s level.

Familiar	Special
Bat	Master gains a +3 bonus on Listen checks
Cat	Master gains a +3 bonus on Move Silently checks
Hawk	Master gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in bright light
Lizard	Master gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks
Owl	Master gains a +3 bonus on Spot checks in shadows
Rat	Master gains a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves
Raven1	Master gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks
Snake2	Master gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks
Toad	Master gains +3 hit points
Weasel	Master gains a +2 bonus on Reflex saves
1 A raven familiar can speak one language of its master''s choice as a supernatural ability.
2 Tiny viper.
Familiar Basics: Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar''s kind, but make the following changes:

Hit Dice: For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master''s character level or the familiar''s normal HD total, whichever is higher.

Hit Points: The familiar has one-half the master''s total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

Attacks: Use the master''s base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar''s Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar''s melee attack bonus with natural weapons. Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar''s kind.

Saving Throws: For each saving throw, use either the familiar''s base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master''s (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn''t share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

Skills: For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal skill ranks for an animal of that type or the master''s skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar''s total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar''s ability to use.

Familiar Ability Descriptions: All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master''s combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.

Natural Armor Adj.: The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar''s existing natural armor bonus.

Int: The familiar''s Intelligence score.

Alertness (Ex): While a familiar is within arm''s reach, the master gains the Alertness feat.

Improved Evasion (Ex): When subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex saving throw for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.

Share Spells: At the master''s option, he may have any spell (but not any spell-like ability) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit. If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself. A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar''s type (magical beast).

Empathic Link (Su): The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar''s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.

Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

Speak with Master (Ex): If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.

Speak with Animals of Its Kind (Ex): If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.

Spell Resistance (Ex): If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains spell resistance equal to the master''s level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar''s spell resistance.

Scry on Familiar (Sp): If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the scrying spell) once per day.

ARCANE SPELLS AND ARMOR
Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively. If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they''ll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats - light, medium, and heavy - and the Shield Proficiency feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.

Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.

By contrast, bards not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes proficient with that armor.

If a spell doesn''t have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster''s hands are bound or if he or she is grappling (although Concentration checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat Still Spell allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.

Aligned Spellcaster
Your passions drive your magical abilities, imbuing your every spell with the power of your conviction. Those who oppose your ideals suffer the most from your magical energy.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Choose an alignment component you have that is not neutral. Spells you cast gain the apropriate alignment descriptor unless they already have the opposite alignment descriptor. For example, a neutral good wizard who selects this ability (and who must choose good) casts all spells that aren''t evil spells as good spells.

Spells you cast that target creatures of the opposite alignment are cast at +1 caster level (+2 if they have the opposite alignment as a subtype). Area of effect and other spells that affect such creatures without targeting them do not gain this bonus. A neutral spellcaster gains no benefit from this ability.

Anagakok
Most primitive societies have sorcerers, shamans, or witch doctors among their ranks, but a lesser-known tradition of cunning arcanists has existed for thousands of years. Found among some of the most barbaric tribes of the world, those who learn this magical discipline do not rely on instincts, personal magnetism, or divinity to weave their magic. Instead, much like the wizards of more civilized societies, they learn their mysterious craft by rote and study their spells each day, using their superior intellects to master the peculiar power of the arcane. Those who follow this path are called anagakoks.

An anagakok (ah nah GA kawk) is an alternative specialist wizard from a primitive society. Born and raised in nature and bound by the traditions of an ancient people, an anagakok has great respect for and control over the environment in which he lives. From an early age, he learns to master the art of survival in the most extreme conditions. Many of his spells grant him a measure of control over animals and plants, and others allow him to move through nature unhindered or unseen. Although he does not necessarily worship deities associated with the wilderness and the source of his power comes from arcane forces rather than from the divine, an anagakok attracts the attention of many lesser spirits of the wild. These fickle beings bestow special boons on the anagakok that make him unnaturally lucky. The members of his tribe regard him as someone who brings good fortune to the people. Most of his tribesmen cling to the belief that a guardian spirit possesses this mysterious magic weaver.

The anagakok is especially concerned with the well-being of his tribe. He helps gather food, finds safe shelter in times of crisis, and defends tribesmates against sometimes impossible odds. Because of his connection to nature and the useful spells he can cast, the anagakok is a vital member of his society. Nevertheless, like many wizards the anagakok is often attracted to a life of adventure and exploration. When an anagakok chooses to become an adventurer, he travels the world seeking to perfect his art.

An adventuring anagakok can be of valuable assistance to any party. Because his magic is especially useful in the wild, he is a great addition to any group that lacks a druid or ranger in its ranks, as well as to any party that specializes in wilderness exploration. A versatile character, the anagakok is not lost in environments unknown to him - such as in great cities.

The anagakok is a variant wizard. Unless otherwise noted, an anagakok advances in the same manner as a wizard (same base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of wizard or anagakok, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level wizard twice.

The anagakok originally appeared as a kit in second edition''s Complete Wizard''s Handbook.

Alignment: Any. Although an anagakok is rarely lawful, he can be of any alignment.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Skills
In addition to those of the standard wizard, the anagakok also has Survival as a class skill.

1 In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 0- through 9th-level spells, an anagakok gets a bonus specialization spell for each spell level for specializing in a distinctive school of magic unique to anagakoks. The "+1" in the entries on this table represents that spell. Bonus specialization spells are in addition to any bonus spells the anagakok may receive for having a high Intelligence score.
Class Features
An anagakok can prepare as many spells per day a regular specialist.

Spellbooks: Just like a wizard, an anagakok must study his spellbook each day to prepare his spells. He cannot prepare any spell not recorded in his spellbook, except for read magic, which all anagakoks can prepare from memory. An anagakok''s spellbook is usually made from crudely cut layers of bark. Some anagakoks even carve the formulas for their spells on stone, tree roots, or other materials found in nature, but most prefer bark because it is lighter and easier to write on.

School Specialization: An anagakok is a specialist wizard (see School Specialization) specializing in a distinctive school of magic unique to anagakoks. Unlike typical wizard schools, the anagakok''s school of magic regroups spells especially useful to survival in harsh environmental conditions as well as spells affecting nature in general. As such, the anagakok school of magic allows him to cast spells not typically available to other wizards (i.e., not on the wizard spell list). As a type of specialist wizard, an anagakok can prepare one additional spell of this specialty school per spell level each day, as normal. These spells go on the anagakok''s spell list, allowing him to prepare them in any spell slot. He also gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells of this school. The anagakok''s prohibited schools are always illusion and necromancy, and he may never learn or cast spells from them. An anagakok cannot become a specialist in any other school.

The anagakok''s school includes the following spells:

0 - create water, know direction, purify food and drink;

1st - calm animals, charm animal, detect animals or plants, detect snares and pits, longstrider, pass without trace;

2nd - animal trance, hold animal, reduce animal, wood shape;

3rd - diminish plants, dominate animal, neutralize poison, quench, snare;

4th - antiplant shell, command plants, repel vermin, rusting grasp;

5th - awaken, commune with nature, control winds, tree stride;

6th - find the path, repel wood, stone tell, transport via plants;

7th - animate plants, transmute metal to wood, windwalk;

8th - animal shapes, control plants, repel metal or stone;

9th - elemental swarm, regenerate, shambler.

Illiteracy: With the exception of arcane spell formulas, the anagakok cannot read or write. He may spend 2 skill points to gain the ability to read and write all languages he is able to speak.

An anagakok who gains a level in any other class except barbarian automatically gains literacy. Any other character who gains an anagakok level does not lose the literacy he already had.

Spontaneous Casting: An anagakok can channel stored spell energy into an endure elements spell the anagakok did not prepare ahead of time. The anagakok can "lose" any prepared spell of 1st level or higher that is not his specialist bonus spell in order to cast endure elements.

Wilderness Lore: An anagakok is learned in the ways of nature. He gains a +2 bonus on Knowledge (nature) and on Survival checks.

Good Fortune: The anagakok is well regarded by the many spirits that inhabit the wilderness and begins to attract their attention early in his career. Blessed by the spirits of nature, he gains a number of good fortune points he can apply (as an immediate action) to any die roll to gain a luck bonus equal to the number of points he expends. At 1st level, he receives 2 good fortune points per day, and this number increases by 2 more points at 5th level and every five levels thereafter. The anagakok may spread out his good fortune points to add bonuses to a number of rolls, checks, or saving throws or expend them all on a single die roll. As a readied action, the anagakok may also choose to expend his good fortune points to grant a luck bonus on the roll of an ally he can touch.

Arcane Reabsorption
You have always focused more on the raw manipulation of arcane energy than others of your profession. As such, you know how to possibly regain that energy when outside forces attempt to disrupt your magic.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Whenever a targeted spell you cast fails to penetrate a creature''s spell resistance or is countered by another spellcaster, you can immediately attempt to reabsorb the arcane energy you just spent as an immediate action. The spell can have no effect at all in order to use this ability. By making a Spellcraft check (DC 20 + [spell level × 3]), you regain the spell as if it was never cast (or regain the spell slot if you cast spells spontaneously). Attempting this taxes your body. Regardless of the success of the check, you take 1 point of nonlethal damage per spell level you attempt to reabsorb. This damage is internal and bypasses damage reduction and resistances you possess.

Beleaguered Spellcaster
The most fragile of all archetypes, arcane spellcasters struggle to avoid taking damage as often as possible. As injuries accumulate your desperation causes your spells to become more effective.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Whenever you take an amount of damage equal to 3 times your spellcaster level from one attack, the next spell you cast is automatically maximized or extended (your choice) without increasing the spell level or casting time.

You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 1 + the spellcasting ability score modifier of the class in which you took this alternative class feature.


Changeling Wizard
The changeling wizard taps into his doppelganger heritage in order to simultaneously specialize in illusion and transmutation. He has an intuitive feel for how to change himself and others (both physically and visually), but gives up some of the standard wizard''s versatility in exchange for these additional talents in deception.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a changeling wizard substitution level, a character must be a changeling about to take his 1st, 5th, or 10th level of wizard.

Class Skills
Changeling wizard substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class, plus Bluff, Disguise, and Sleight of Hand.

Skill Points at Each Level: 4 + Int modifi er (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the changeling wizard''s racial substitution levels.

Dual Specialization (Ex): At 1st level, a changeling wizard can choose to pursue a dual specialization in illusion and transmutation. To do so, he must give up three other schools of magic (but just as for a normal specialist wizard, a changeling wizard can''t give up divination to fulfill this requirement).

A changeling wizard can prepare one additional spell per spell level each day, chosen from either of his specialty schools. For instance, he might choose to prepare ghost sound (illusion) as his additional 0-level spell and expeditious retreat (transmutation) as his additional 1st-level spell.

In addition, he gains a +2 bonus on Spellcraft checks to learn spells from either of these schools. This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard''s specialization option.

Limited Spell Knowledge: A changeling wizard''s focused studies in illusion and transmutation lead to an excess of knowledge in those areas, but limit his ability to easily add spells of other schools to his spellbook. Each time the character selects a changeling wizard substitution level (other than 1st level), he chooses three spells from the illusion or transmutation schools to add to his spellbook in lieu of the normal two spells added to the standard wizard''s spellbook upon gaining a new wizard level. This has no effect on a changeling wizard''s ability to add other spells to his spellbook, such as those taken from a scroll or from another wizard''s spellbook.

Morphic Familiar (Su): At 5th level, a changeling wizard''s familiar gains the ability to alter its form on command. As a full-round action, the familiar can change its form to that of any creature that the wizard could normally have as a familiar. The wizard gains the new benefit of the familiar while losing the previous benefit. If the changeling wizard does not have a familiar, this ability has no effect until he gains one.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard''s bonus feat gained at 5th level.

Override Transmutation (Ex): A changeling wizard''s skill with transmutation spells serves as a good defense against them. Starting at 10th level, if he fails his normal saving throw against a transmutation spell or spell-like ability with a duration other than instantaneous, a changeling wizard can attempt an additional save 1 round later against the same DC.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard''s bonus feat gained at 10th level.

Combat Wizard
Some wizards trade their knowledge of magic and craft to improve their combat prowess.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Scribe Scroll, wizard bonus feat list.

Gain: Bonus feat list (as fighter; bonus feats gained at 1st level and every five levels as wizard).

Dead Levels
The wizard has fifteen dead levels, but she shares a lot in common with the sorcerer in that new spells are gained at every level (which can be considered special abilities in their own right). The primary difference between the two classes is that while sorcerers lose nothing by taking a prestige class granting +1 level of arcane spellcasting at every level, wizards miss out on up to four metamagic or item creation feats. As such, wizards are granted the least significant dead level ability.

Animated Script (Su): Starting at 2nd level, a wizard can magically animate the writing in their spellbook, causing the inked symbols and words to migrate across the page. Doing so increases the Spellcraft DC for another wizard attempting to decipher or prepare spells from their spellbook by the inscribing wizard''s Intelligence modifier + 1 at the cost of 5 gp per inscribed page. See Spells Copied from Another''s Spellbook or Scroll. For each level in which the character does not gain a bonus feat after 2nd level, the wizard can increase the Spellcraft DC by +1 at the cost of an additional 5 gp per inscribed page (for example, +2 for 10 gp per page at 3rd level, +3 for 15 gp per page at 4th level, +4 for 20 gp per page at 6th level, and so on). The inscribing wizard can will their animated writing to stop, at which point the Spellcraft DC to copy a spell from another''s spellbook returns to normal (DC 15 + spell level).

Deathwalker
From the earliest days of her training, the deathwalker works to gain immortality as an undead creature. The first stages of her transformation are simple changes that leave her mostly alive. As her necromantic prowess increases, however, the dark energies she commands slowly kill off her corporeal form, rotting it from the inside out. By the time she reaches 20th level, she has completed her transformation into an undead creature.

The deathwalker invests more time and effort in achieving immortality this way than she would by using other means, but the gradual change allows her to gain control of potent necromantic magic as she undergoes the necessary physical changes. Furthermore, as she grows in power, her capacity to command and control other undead creatures increases. The deathwalker may follow a more arduous road to eternal life than other necromancers, but the end result is immortality plus power - a potent combination indeed.

Deathwalkers crave undeath, and they view necromancy as a useful tool for collecting and commanding utterly obedient undead servants. Many deathwalkers are utterly amoral, seeing living beings in the same light as they do skeletons or zombies. Both categories of beings, living and mindless undead, are little more than tools or objects to be used and manipulated for their own twisted ends. Some deathwalkers are content to remain in their isolated towers and strongholds, but most are too ambitious to rest on their laurels. Their casual disdain for the living leads them to pursue rituals that require the deaths of hundreds of innocents with little concern for the potential repercussions of their actions.

Alignment: Any evil.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Skills
The deathwalker''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Bluff (Cha), Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

1 In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 0- through 9th-level spells, a deathwalker gets a bonus necromancy spell for each spell level for specializing in the necromancy school. The "+1" in the entries on this table represents that spell. Bonus necromancy spells are in addition to any bonus spells the deathwalker may receive for having a high Intelligence score.
Class Features
All of the following are class features of the deathwalker.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Like most arcane spellcasters, a deathwalker receives only minimal training with weapons and none with armor. She is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a deathwalker''s movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail.

Spells: A deathwalker casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list in the Player''s Handbook. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time, like a wizard. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a deathwalker must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a deathwalker''s spell is 10 + the spell level the deathwalker''s Intelligence modifier.

Like a wizard, a deathwalker can cast only a certain number of arcane spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on the table for her class. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.

All deathwalkers function as necromancer specialist wizards for the purpose of spellcasting. They must specialize in necromancy and choose prohibited schools as per the standard rules for specialist wizards.

Spellbooks: A deathwalker must record her spells in thick books. Each morning, she pores over these tomes to prepare her spells for use later in the day. The deathwalker can prepare read magic from memory, but all other spells must appear in her spellbooks before she can prepare them. A deathwalker gains all 0-level wizard spells (except for those from prohibited schools) at 1st level. In addition, she gains three 1st-level spells and an additional number equal to her Intelligence bonus. Thereafter, each time the deathwalker achieves a new level, she gains two new spells of any level or levels that her new level allows her to cast.

Like a wizard, a deathwalker may select the Spell Mastery feat.

Master of the Dead (Sp): At 1st level, the deathwalker gains the ability to bind certain undead creatures to her service, controlling them as though with animate dead. If the deathwalker or any of her allies attack a controlled creature, control is immediately broken for that creature.

Upon confronting a zombie or skeleton, the deathwalker can attempt a Charisma check (DC 15 + the undead''s Hit Dice) to command it. She cannot use this method if she or any of her comrades have already attacked the target creature.

A deathwalker can control only 5 HD worth of skeletons and zombies per deathwalker level. (Treat undead with less than one Hit Die as 1-HD undead for the purpose of this ability.) If she attempts to gain control of undead in excess of her limit, she must immediately release already controlled zombies and skeletons from her service until the number she has under her control falls to or below her limit. The limit of 5 x the deathwalker''s class levels is the maximum number of Hit Dice of mindless undead that the deathwalker can control by any means, including animate dead, (That is, casting animate dead does not allow the deathwalker to exceed this limit.)

The deathwalker''s ability to control undead using master of the dead extends only to skeletons and zombies.

At this point in her development, the deathwalker gains a pale complexion and an unnaturally low body temperature. Her hands are cold to the touch, and her eyes have a glassy look. She takes a -2 penalty on all Fortitude saves to resist negative levels as her life force begins to waver within her physical shell.

Undead Familiar: A deathwalker''s familiar is always an undead creature. The deathwalker uses all the standard rules that a wizard would for gaining a familiar, but the creature that arrives immediately becomes undead. Its type changes to undead, and all its Hit Dice become d12s (this does not affect its hit points). Like other undead, it has no Constitution score. It gains darkvision to a range of 60 feet if it did not already have it, and it also gains the standard undead traits. Treat the familiar''s Hit Dice as equal to its master''s for the purpose of turn, rebuke, or bolster attempts. The creature cannot be commanded by anyone save its own master.

Aura of the Grave (Ex): At 5th level, the deathwalker continues her slow descent into an undead state. She no longer needs to sleep, and she gains immunity to sleep effects. She also becomes immune to all diseases. Her nerve endings begin to dull, making her less able to feel pain.

The physical effects of the deathwalker''s continuing transformation become more marked at this point. Her skin draws tightly over her body, giving her a hollow, empty look. Any person viewing her may make a Knowledge (arcana) check (DC 25) to determine that she follows the deathwalker''s path. Because of her decreased tactile sense, she may absentmindedly skewer her hand with a needle while deep in thought, singe her hand on a hot stove without noticing, or fail to note the flies that land on her eye or buzz in or near her mouth. Slowly but surely, she continues to lose her grip on life.

Shroud of Death (Ex): As the deathwalker''s magical prowess increases, her physical body continues to fail. Yet, in many ways, she becomes stronger than ever. As her body dies, her organs rot in place, but the necromantic energies she has learned to harness keep her bodily processes functioning enough to sustain the shred of life remaining in her.

At 10th level, the deathwalker gains a +4 circumstance bonus on saves against poison, paralysis, and mind-affecting effects. Since her organs have largely ceased functioning, there is a 50% chance that extra damage from a critical his or sneak attack does not affect her. This ability works much like the fortification special armor quality. She no longer needs to eat or drink to stay alive (although she still must breathe). However, the stench of decay that surrounds her imposes a -2 penalty on Charisma, Bluff, and Diplomacy checks against any creatures except undead.

Mastery of Undeath (Su): At 15th level, the deathwalker gains the ability to force obedience and servitude From even the mightiest undead creatures. The raw force of her necromantic magic combined with the slow replacement of her living body with undead flesh make her appear as a commanding, regal figure to the undead. She gains the ability to rebuke or command undead as an evil cleric of her deathwalker level a number of times per day equal to 1 + her Charisma bonus (if any).

She also develops further outward signs of her descent into undeath. Her stomach bloats and may even split open because of the rot within her body, and her teeth turn yellow and fall from her gums.

Mantle of Undeath: At 20th level, the deathwalker finally becomes an undead creature. She loses her Constitution score and any bonus hit points she had previously gained from it, and her Hit Die type becomes d12 (but the deathwalker''s hit point total does not change). Her type changes to undead, and she gains the standard undead traits. She does not lose any of the racial traits she previously possessed, and her attack bonuses, save bonuses, and other statistics are not recalculated.

Disciple of Boccob
As a deeply loyal and pious student of Boccob the Uncaring, you know the secret to creating powerful magic items through your understanding of the Archmage of the Deities'' teachings.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: You qualify for item creation feats as a character 1 level higher. Magic items you create are crafted at +1 caster level. The item gains this bonus for free; you do not pay the extra cost associated with a higher caster level. If you destroy a permanent magic item you lose all arcane spellcasting abilities for a day per caster level of the item.

Domain Granted Power
So great are the extent of your study and the depth of your faith that you can call upon the power of one of your deity''s domains.

Level: 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a wizard at 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th level.

Benefit: Choose one cleric domain. If you worship a specific deity, the domain you choose must be one to which your deity grants access. You now can use that domain''s granted power as a cleric does, but you do not gain access to its spells or extra spell slots. If the granted power is based upon cleric level, it becomes instead based upon your wizard level.

Special: If you take levels in a class that grants you a domain choice (such as cleric), you gain the full benefits of the domain in addition to the other domains available to you from that class.

Domain Wizard
A wizard who uses the arcane domain system (called a domain wizard) selects a specific arcane domain of spells, much like a cleric selects a pair of domains associated with his deity. A domain wizard cannot also be a specialist wizard; in exchange for the versatility given up by specializing in a domain instead of an entire school, the domain wizard casts her chosen spells with increased power.

Some of the arcane domains described below have the same name as a divine domain. Regardless of any apparent similarity, these domains have no connection to one another.

Class Features
The domain wizard has all the standard wizard class features, except as noted below.

Arcane Domain: At 1st level, a domain wizard selects an arcane domain from those listed below. (At the game master''s discretion, the player might create an alternatively themed domain instead.) Once selected, the domain may never be changed.

A domain wizard automatically adds each new domain spell to her list of known spells as soon as she becomes able to cast it. These spells do not count against her two new spells known per wizard level.

A domain wizard casts spells from her chosen domain (regardless of whether the spell was prepared as a domain spell or a normal spell) as a caster one level higher than her normal level. This bonus applies only to the spells listed for the domain, not all spells of the school or subtype whose name matches the domain name.

In some cases, an arcane domain includes spells not normally on the wizard''s class spell list. These spells are treated as being on the character''s class spell list (and thus she can use wands or arcane scrolls that hold those spells, or even prepare those spells in her normal wizard spell slots).

Spellcasting: A domain wizard prepares and casts spells like a normal wizard. However, a domain wizard gains one bonus spell per spell level, which must be filled with the spell from that level of the domain spell list (or with a lower-level domain spell that has been altered with a metamagic feat).

No Prohibited Schools: Unlike a specialist wizard, a domain wizard need not select any prohibited schools or domains. All wizard spells are available to her to learn.

Drakken Familiar
Arcane spellcasters, even those who don''t claim the blood of dragons as their own, often have a special link with dragonkind. One manifestation of this link is the caster''s familiar, which can take on draconic characteristics.

Class: Hexblade, sorcerer, or wizard.

Level: 4th (hexblade) or 1st (sorcerer or wizard).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, your familiar does not gain all the benefits normally accorded to a familiar. See below to determine which alternative benefits it gains, and which standard benefits these replace.

Benefit: Your familiar is a drakken version of a normal animal. It gains the dragonblood subtype and all the benefits of being a familiar, except as described below.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to deliver touch spells, it gains a breath weapon instead. This breath is a 15-foot cone of fire, usable once per hour, that deals a number of points of damage equal to 1d6 + twice your class level (levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for this purpose). A successful Reflex save (10 + 1/2 your total class levels for determining the familiar''s abilities) halves the damage dealt.

When your familiar would normally gain the ability to speak with animals of its kind, it instead gains the ability to speak with creatures of the dragon type.

Drow Wizard
Wizards are among the most feared and admired nondivine members of drow society. Despite their innate resistance to magic, the drow have great respect for both the spells and the knowledge available to these masters of the arcane arts. Although they are not directly tied to Lolth in the way divine casters and warlocks are, their devotion to the Spider Queen - and indeed, their very upbringing within society - has led to the development of race-specific wizard traits.

Abyssal Specialist
Most wizards who choose to specialize do so in a specific school. Many drow wizards instead focus on a variety of spells closely linked to the powers and objectives of the Weaver of Webs. The basic mechanic for specialization is the same, but the specifics differ.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you cannot specialize in a school of magic, and you lose the ability to cast spells from a prohibited school.

You must select one school of magic to serve as your prohibited school, and you can never cast spells from it or use spell completion and spell trigger devices connected to it, as per normal specialist rules. You may not select divination as your prohibited school.

Benefit: You are considered specialized, but not in a specific school. Rather, you gain all the benefits of specialization with a group of spells that includes all those of the following subschools and/or descriptors: chaotic, compulsion, darkness, evil, and fear. You gain all the standard benefits of specialization as applied to this group of spells, as though it were a school unto itself.

Dukar
These wizards of a dwindling order protect the tenuous peace under the Sea of Fallen Stars, working quietly and secretly to achieve their goals and rebuild their numbers. Many of their powers stem from living coral implanted under the skin of their hands.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a Dukar substitution level, a character must be a member of the Dukars, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), and be about to take his 5th, 10th, or 15th level of wizard. The first time a character takes a Dukar substitution level, he must undergo a secret Dukar ritual that implants the living coral under the skin of his palms (see Dukar hand coral). The coral does not interfere with using his hands in any way. If the Dukar somehow loses this coral, he loses his coral-related powers, but if he is implanted again he immediately regains his full abilities.

Class Skills
Dukar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class plus Swim.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.


Table: Dukar Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
5th	+2	+1	+1	+4	Coral claw, bonus spells	Same as wizard
10th	+5	+3	+3	+7	Coral power, bonus spells	Same as wizard
15th	+7/+2	+5	+5	+9	Coral power, bonus spells	Same as wizard
Class Features
All of the following are features of the Dukar substitution levels.

Bonus Spells (Ex): There are four Dukar orders, each with two associated schools of magic. Upon taking his first Dukar substitution level, a Dukar chooses one order and can never change it thereafter (similar to choosing a wizard specialty school). Each time a Dukar substitution level is taken, a Dukar adds two spells to his spell book; these must be from one or both of his order''s associated schools of magic (either one from each or both from the same). A specialist wizard Dukar is not restricted to choosing these bonus spells from his school of specialization, but he cannot use them to acquire spells from his prohibited school (therefore, choosing an order that studies one of your prohibited schools is normally a bad choice). The orders are as follows.

Order	Color	Schools of Magic
Jhimar*	Red	Enchantment, evocation
Kupav	Blue	Aburation, transmutation
Maalirn	Green	Conjuration, divination
Numos	White	Illusion, necromancy
* The order of Jhimar was destroyed centuries ago and its knowledge and traditions are lost.

This class feature replaces the standard wizard''s ability to add two spells to his spellbook each time he gains a wizard level.

Coral Claw (Ex): At 5th level, a Dukar can extend the coral under his skin to form sharp spikes on his hand, giving him a claw attack that deals 1d4 points of damage. The Dukar is automatically proficient in the coral weapon and can extend or retract the coral as a swift action.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat normally gained by a 5th-level wizard.

Coral Power: At 10th and 15th level, a Dukar learns how to use his implanted coral in different ways. Each time this ability is gained, a Dukar chooses one ability from the following choices. Each ability can be taken twice, with increasing effect.

Acid (Ex): A Dukar adds 1d4 points of acid damage to all claw attacks (including those made with his coral claw; see above). The acid quickly decays and cannot be stored for later use. A Dukar and his gear are not harmed by his own coral''s acid. This ability functions automatically, though a Dukar can suspend or resume this ability as a free action. If a Dukar selects the ability a second time, the acid damage increases to 1d8 points.

Armor (Ex): Three times per day as a standard action, a Dukar can make his coral extend hard growths across his skin, giving him a +1 enhancement bonus to his natural armor bonus to AC. These growths crumble to dust after 10 minutes. If a Dukar selects this ability a second time, the enhancement bonus to his natural armor increases to +2.

Color Spray (Sp): A Dukar''s coral gains the ability to glow intensely in confusing patterns. At will as a standard action, a Dukar can use this light as a color spray effect. Using this ability requires the Dukar to have one hand free, uncovered, and able to make gestures. The save DC of this ability is Intelligence-based. If a Dukar takes this ability a second time, the save DC of this ability increases by 2.

Wound Transfer (Su): A Dukar''s coral develops the ability to transfer life energy by touch from him to another creature, healing its wounds at the expense of his own health. Each use of this ability heals the target of 1d6 points of damage and deals a like amount of damage to the Dukar. If a Dukar chooses this ability a second time, he heals the target of 2d6 points of damage and takes a like amount of damage per use. This ability can never provide a target more hit points than its full normal total +10. Any hit points gained beyond its normal maximum are treated as temporary hit points that last for up to 1 hour.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat normally gained by a 10th- or 15th-level wizard.

Eidetic Spellcaster
Unlike other wizards, you can see within your mind the intricate arcane symbols, words, and gestures that define your spells. Your photographic memory acts as your spellbook, inscribing the spells you know within your mind.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar or the Scribe Scroll bonus feat.

Benefit: You do not need a spellbook, either to record spells you know or to prepare known spells. You can learn spells normally, either through gaining levels in wizard or learning from other spellbooks, and you must pay all the normal costs for learning new spells (used instead in special incenses rather than inks), but you do not need to put them into a spellbook.


Elf Wizard
Elves are naturally enthralled by the study of magic, and many of history''s most famous wizards were elves. Elf wizards typically prefer a general approach to magic, recognizing the value in versatility.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take an elf wizard substitution level, a character must be an elf about to take her 1st, 3rd, or 5th level of wizard.

Class Skills
Elf wizard substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard wizard class, plus Search.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).

Class Features
All the following are features of the elf wizard''s racial substitution levels.

Generalist Wizardry: A 1st-level elf wizard begins play with one extra 1st-level spell in her spellbook. At each new wizard level, she gains one extra spell of any spell level that she can cast. This represents the additional elven insight and experience with arcane magic.

The elf wizard may also prepare one additional spell of her highest spell level each day. Unlike the specialist wizard ability, this spell may be of any school.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard''s ability to specialize in a school of magic.

Natural Link (Su): At 3rd level, an elf wizard''s link to her familiar strengthens. The bonus on skill checks, saves, or hit points granted by the familiar doubles. For example, the cat familiar of an elf wizard grants a +6 bonus on Move Silently checks (rather than +3), a weasel familiar grants a +4 bonus on Reflex saves (rather than +2), and a toad familiar grants +6 hit points (rather than +3). This increase only applies when the familiar is within arm''s reach of the wizard; when the creature is farther away than that, the normal bonus applies (unless the familiar is more than one mile away, in which case no bonus applies).

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard familiar''s ability to deliver touch spells (normally gained by the familiar of a 3rd-level wizard) and the familiar''s ability to speak with animals of its kind (normally gained by the familiar of a 7th-level wizard). If the wizard''s familiar already has either of these abilities (for instance, if the character is a multiclass sorcerer/wizard), it loses those abilities when the wizard selects this substitution level.

Bonus Feat: At 5th level, an elf wizard gains a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: Defensive Archery, Far Shot, Point Blank Shot, Precise Shot, Rapid Shot, or Weapon Focus (longbow/composite longbow or shortbow/composite shortbow only). The wizard must still meet all prerequisites for a bonus feat.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard''s bonus feat gained at 5th level.

1 Loyalty, while admirable in anyone, can greatly benefit sorcerers or wizards who keep their original familiars throughout their careers. Those who take the Improved Familiar feat and refuse to cast aside their cherished animal partner in favor of a more powerful creature might explore new abilities derived from this enhanced connection. There are several enhancements an arcane spellcaster with the Improved Familiar feat might gain if he retains his original familiar rather than acquiring a new and more powerful one. Each enhancement has a requisite level in an arcane spellcasting class as well as a specific familiar.

Blindsense (Ex): You gain blindsense out to 20 feet. Using nonvisual senses, such as acute smell or hearing, you notice things others cannot see.

Hallucinatory Perspiration (Ex): Your sweat causes creatures rash enough to bite you to suffer violent hallucinations. Whenever a creature vulnerable to poison bites you it must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 your arcane spellcaster class levels + your Constitution modifier) or be affected by the confusion spell for 1d4 rounds.

Nine Lives (Su): When you roll to stabilize, you have a 50% chance of success instead of the standard 10% chance.

Regrow (Ex): You can heal your own wounds as a paladin lays on hands. Each day you can heal a total number of hit points of damage equal to half your arcane spellcasting level × your Charisma modifier).

Scent (Su): You gain the scent ability. You can identify familiar odors just as normal humans do familiar sights.

Second Memory (Ex): You may seek your familiar''s sometimes dubious advice. Whenever you attempt a Knowledge check for a Knowledge skill in which you have at least 1 rank your raven familiar attempts to assist you. It need only make a DC 10 Intelligence check to do so. If it succeeds, you receive the standard +2 bonus on your skill check.

Self-Cannibalize (Su): Your will to survive allows you to feed upon your magic. Once per day you may, as a free action, sacrifice one of your available spell slots or prepared spells to convert some lethal damage you take from an attack or spell into nonlethal damage. The level of the spell sacrificed represents the number of hit points converted into nonlethal damage.

Tracker (Su): You gain a +2 bonus on Move Silently checks. You also gain low-light vision. If you already have low-light vision, you can see three times as far as a normal human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of poor illumination.

Swarm Familiars: To gain a swarm familiar, you must have the Improved Familiar feat. This permits the following modifications to the standard rules for familiars as described in the Player''s Handbook. An animal or vermin swarm becomes a magical beast swarm familiar. Swarms of other types retain their type when they become swarm familiars. Swarms without an Intelligence score, such as vermin, gain an Intelligence score of 1. Swarm familiars do not gain the ability to speak with others of their kind, and neither the swarm nor its master gains the Alertness feat. Instead, the following special qualities are substituted for those standard familiar abilities.

Granted Abilities: In addition to special abilities gained as a result of standard familiar progression, swarm familiars also bestow the following abilities upon their masters. The swarm''s master gains immunity to her familiar''s nauseating effect and any of its other special attacks (filth fever, spider poison, and so on) and can occupy the same space as her familiar without suffering penalties. Swarm familiar granted abilities replace the granted abilities listed for improved familiars.

Hive Mind (Ex): Swarm familiars gain a hive mind that connects them to each other by the arcane power of their master. The master gains an empathic link and the ability to share spells with the hive mind of the swarm familiar.

Nonhealing (Ex): When a swarm takes damage, part of it is physically destroyed. Therefore, swarm familiars cannot be healed in the normal manner. Instead, new creatures must be summoned to the swarm to replace those that have died. A summon swarm spell "cures" a swarm familiar by replacing dead creatures in the swarm at a rate of 1d6 hit points per caster level. The number of hit points healed in this manner cannot exceed the swarm''s maximum hit point total. Only a druid or the wizard to whom the swarm familiar belongs can cure a swarm familiar in this fashion. Summon swarm spells used to heal a familiar create no other effect.

Filidh
Highly respected lawgivers of barbarian society, filidhs draw their power from their knowledge and application of lore. They provide judgments in legal disputes and defend their people using the mysterious ways of their ancestors. If shamans are the conscience of the tribe and skalds its memory, then filidhs are its unshakable will.

The filidh is a variant wizard. Unless otherwise noted, a filidh advances in the same manner as a wizard (same Hit Die, base attack bonus, saving throw bonuses, skill points, and so on). When a character elects to take a level of wizard or filidh, he may not later take levels in the other class. This prevents the character from gaining the benefits of a 1st-level wizard twice.

Filidhs seek to preserve the beliefs of their tribe. As enforcers of ancestral traditions, they seek out magical power to increase their knowledge and strengthen their position within the tribe. These barbaric lore keepers tend toward neutral alignments, although both lawful and chaotic societies have traditions filidhs might seek to uphold. To aid them, most filidhs typically devote a significant number of spells to divination, balancing them with other offensive or supporting spells. These tribal wizards equate knowledge with power and carefully dispense their learning to a select few. They tend to play subtle but domineering roles in any group, even if they do not obviously lead it. Many filidhs associate with religious orders or druids as they often hold similar perspectives and goals.

Devout and spiritual beyond most traditional wizards, filidhs usually worship gods of knowledge, magic, poetry, or travel. They also highly respect and might worship creator gods, as they are usually credited with teaching laws to the first mortals. Other filidhs worship nature gods and explore the secrets of both the natural and the unseen world.

Class Skills
The filidh''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Decipher Script (Int), Gather Information (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Sense Motive (Wis), Spellcraft (Int), and Survival (Wis).

Class Features
The filidh loses the base wizard''s Scribe Scroll, bonus feats, and summon familiar class features but gains several abilities related to knowledge and divination. All of the following are class features of the filidh.

Weapon and Armor Proficiencies: Filidhs are proficient with the club, dagger, quarterstaff, and shortbow but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a filidh''s movements, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail.

Filidh Knowledge: This ability functions as the bardic knowledge ability. A filidh with levels in another class that grants bardic knowledge stacks those levels with her filidh levels when determining her total bonus to bardic knowledge checks.

Greater Divining: A filidh is able to cast divination spells as if her caster level was +1 level higher at 5th level. This ability increases to +2 levels higher at 10th level, +3 levels higher at 15th level, and +4 levels higher at 20th level.

Fleshcrafter
Death is the converse of life. The same forces that can drain a creature''s life force can also channel that energy and forge it into useful tools. Thus, although necromancy delves into the power of death, the fleshcrafter can use it to gain control over life, manipulating it to his own ends. His black magic creates unholy abominations - mockeries of life built from the blood and bone of his countless victims. He sees living creatures in the same light that an artist sees a canvas and paints, but his "art" consists of twisting, and forming those raw materials into whatever shapes suit his foul goals.

The fleshcrafter lurks at the edge of society, picking off the weak and those unlikely to be missed. His lab might feature still-beating hearts kept alive in a vat of demonic ichor, furniture crafted from creatures'' limbs that moves and adjusts itself on command, and half-formed jigsaws of body parts that vaguely resemble humanoid forms. Many fleshcrafters seek out victims who have particular features - innocents with the perfect arms, feet, or other body parts - for their experiments. To the typical fleshcrafter, such victims are like apple trees with fruit ripe for harvest.

Alignment: Any evil.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Skills
The fleshcrafter''s class skills and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Heal (Wis), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

1 In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 0- through 9th-level spells, a fleshcrafter gets a bonus necromancy spell for each spell level for specializing in the necromancy school. The "+1" in the entries on this table represents that spell. Bonus necromancy spells are in addition to any bonus spells the fleshcrafter may receive for having a high Intelligence score.
Class Features
All of the following are class features of the fleshcrafter. When an ability requires humanoid bodies, the fleshcrafter can substitute corpses of different size categories, according to the following equivalences.

One Corpse of
This Size Equals...	Number of
Medium Corpses
Small	1/2
Large	4
Huge	16
Gargantuan	64
Colossal	256
Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Like most arcane spellcasters, a fleshcrafter receives only minimal training with weapons and none with armor. He is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a fleshcrafter''s movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail.

Spells: A fleshcrafter casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list in the Player''s Handbook. He must choose and prepare his spells ahead of time, like a wizard. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a fleshcrafter must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a fleshcrafter''s spell is 10 + the spell level the fleshcrafter''s Intelligence modifier.

Like a wizard, a fleshcrafter can cast only a certain number of arcane spells of each spell level per day. His base daily spell allotment is given on the table for his class. In addition, he receives bonus spells per day if he has a high Intelligence score.

All fleshcrafters function as necromancer specialist wizards for the purpose of spellcasting. They must specialize in necromancy and choose prohibited schools as per the standard rules for specialist wizards.

Spellbooks: A fleshcrafter must record his spells in thick books. Each morning, he pores over these tomes to prepare his spells for use later in the day. The fleshcrafter can prepare read magic from memory, but all other spells must appear in his spellbooks before he can prepare them. A fleshcrafter gains all 0-level wizard spells (except for those from prohibited schools) at 1st level. In addition, he gains three 1st-level spells and an additional number equal to his Intelligence bonus. Thereafter, each time the fleshcrafter achieves a new level, he gains two new spells of any level or levels that his new level allows him to cast.

Like a wizard, a fleshcrafter may select the Spell Mastery feat.

Craft Construct: A fleshcrafter gains Craft Construct as a bonus feat.

Stitched Flesh Familiar: While other spellcasters summon familiars to do their bidding, the fleshcrafter forms his own. He can build a construct familiar with a value of 300 gp by gathering the necessary body parts from three Medium humanoids that he has killed, and making successful DC 18 Craft checks. He must then donate a portion of his own life force to grant his construct the spark of life. This portion of the process costs an additional 100 gp in components. (Failing the Craft check uses up this last 100 gp as well as any other wasted materials and money.) This shared life force creates such a deep bond between the two that the fleshcrafter cannot create another such familiar until his current servant dies.

A stitched flesh familiar gains the abilities indicated on the Stitched Flesh Familiar Abilities table, based on its master''s level. It also gains all the abilities described under "Familiar Basics" in the Familiars section. Many of the abilities below are standard familiar abilities, but the stitched flesh familiar gains them at a slower rate. A few are unique to the familiar.

Table: Stitched Flesh Familiar Special Abilities

Master
Class Level	Natural
Armor Adj.	Int	Special
1st-2nd	+1	6	Empathic link, improved evasion, uncanny likeness
3rd-4th	+2	7	Alertness, share spells
5th-6th	+3	8	Deliver touch spells, speak with master
7th-8th	+4	9	—
9th-10th	+5	10	Sustained spirit
11th-12th	+6	11	Spell resistance
13th-14th	+7	12	Scry on familiar
15th-16th	+8	13	—
17th-18th	+9	14	—
19th-20th	+10	15	—
Uncanny Likeness: The close link that the stitched flesh familiar has with its master alters its physical appearance. Anyone who sees the familiar and has already seen its master may make a DC 20 Spot check to note the similarity between the two.

Sustained Spirit: When the fleshcrafter reaches 9th level, his link with his stitched flesh familiar becomes strong enough to survive after death. If a fleshcrafter creates a new stitched flesh familiar to replace a lost one, the newly created servant has all the memories of the previous one, as well as the same personality. Thus, a stitched flesh familiar created to replace one that was killed under mysterious circumstances can remember the details of its predecessor''s death (including the killers, if it saw them).

Reaper''s Touch (Ex): At 1st level, the fleshcrafter gains such an intimate knowledge of living things that he can increase the chances of a creature''s death while appearing to heal it. When using the Heal skill to treat another creature, he may instead double any hit point or ability score damage his patient takes due to any conditions from which it already suffers. The Heal DC decreases by 5 when he uses the skill for this purpose, and the effect lasts for 24 hours. Thus, a creature with fewer than 0 hit points loses 2 hit points per round rather than 1.

Furthermore, the affected creature cannot check to stabilize as long as the creature is taking extra damage from this ability. An observer may make a Heal check opposed by the fleshcrafter''s Heal check result to notice the latter''s sabotage of the patient. A successful Heal check opposed by the fleshcrafter''s Heal result or the application of any sort of healing magic is sufficient to halt the accelerated loss of life.

Brink of Life and Death (Ex): At 5th level, the fleshcrafter gains the ability to more rapidly pinpoint the critical veins and organs he must destroy to slay a creature. Thus, he can make a coup de grace attack as a standard action. Furthermore, the fleshcrafter can extend this ability to his stitched flesh familiar as long the latter is within range of its empathic link with him. To share this ability, the fleshcrafter must concentrate on the stitched flesh famillar as a full-round action, but the coup de grace remains a standard action for the stitched flesh familiar.

Forge Flesh: At 10th level, the fleshcrafter unlocks the basic secrets of mimicking life. He may gather body parts to produce custom-designed animated creatures that have a vague semblance of life, such as chairs with elf legs, or racks built of outstretched arms. Such creatures count as animated objects, although they are crafted from organs, bones, and flesh taken from the fleshcrafter''s victims.

For each 2 HD of the animated object to be created, the fleshcrafter must harvest body parts from one Medium creature, make a successful Craft check (DC 20), and devote 200 gp worth of chemicals, noxious fluids, and rare herbs to the creation process. When complete, the animated object obeys the fleshcrafter to the best of its ability without question. A fleshcrafter may create and control animated objects whose total HD are no more than twice his fleshcrafter level.

Master of Life and Death (Su): At 15th level, the fleshcrafter perfects his understanding of life, death, and magic. His spells are so attuned to the patterns and energy of life that they are difficult for living creatures to resist. When the fleshcrafter affects a living creature (that is, any creature other than a construct or undead) with a spell, the DC for the saving throw (if any) increases by +1.

Forge Life (Ex): At 20th level, the fleshcrafter can use his knowledge of arcane magic and biology to create a flesh golem using special, rare methods that only he and others of his class can access. The fleshcrafter need spend only 5,000 gp to produce the golem, although he must still meet all the remaining prerequisites, and spend the standard amount of time and XP based on the value of the flesh golem listed in the Monster Manual. In addition, he must collect body parts from the equivalent equivalent of at least twenty different Medium humanoids that he personally killed to assemble the golem. The fleshcrafter can create any number of flesh golems in this manner.

Focus Caster
A familiar offers companionship and, when necessary, an effective scout or spy. It does little for your spellcasting, however. This option presents you with a less generally useful item that instead enhances your spellcasting in some way.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Instead of a familiar, you bind yourself to a masterwork item that acts as a focus for all your spells and that enhances the power of spells of one school. Once you have a masterwork item to bind to, you must perform a ritual that requires 24 hours and reagents costing 100 gp, much as if you were summoning a familiar.

When casting any spell, you must hold, wield, or wear this item (as appropriate), in addition to providing the normal components of the spell (even other foci). Your focus item is used in addition to the spell''s normal components, not instead of. You are automatically considered proficient with your focus item, but you do not gain proficiency with any other item (weapon or armor) of the same type. For example, if your focus item is a longsword, you are proficient with your focus longsword but not with any other longsword, unless of course another feat or class feature grants you proficiency. When you cast a spell from the school to which your focus belongs, that spell is enhanced. At 7th and 15th levels, your focus grants additional abilities.

You may have only one focus item at a time. A specialist wizard may select only the focus appropriate to her specialty school. Bonuses gained from a focus item stack with similar bonuses gained from feats such as Spell Focus or Spell Penetration.

Your focus item grows tougher as you advance in level. The hardness of your focus item increases by one-half your caster level, up to double its normal hardness. In addition, your focus item gains additional hit points equal to your caster level, up to double its normal number of hit points. These bonuses are in addition to any increase in hardness or hit points the item gains for being made into a magic item.

If your focus item can be enhanced with magic, it costs you less XP to do so. When determining your XP cost for making your focus item into a magic item (or for upgrading it later), reduce the base cost by 10%. This reduction stacks with any other reduction you might gain, such as from the Legendary Artisan feat. Another character enhancing your focus item does not gain this reduction in XP cost.

If your focus item is destroyed, you must bind yourself to another masterwork item. You cannot bind to an item that is already a magic item. You can only bind to masterwork items. The item can be made of special materials (such as adamantine, cold iron, or darkwood).

The following items are typical foci for each of the standard schools.

Abjuration: Usually a set of bracers, a buckler, or a small shield (wooden or steel), your focus grants any nonpersonal abjuration spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, you may cast any personal abjuration spell as a touch spell.

Conjuration: Usually a gnarled and twisted quarterstaff or other polearm, your focus increases the duration of any conjuration spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 3 rounds.

Divination: Usually a large crystal (loose or mounted on a rod or staff) or ornate holy symbol, your focus increases the caster level of any divination spell you cast by +1. At 7th level, the duration of any divination spell you cast doubles. At 15th level, you gain a bonus to resist divinations equal to 1 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1).

Enchantment: Usually an ornate and typically nonfunctional piece of clothing, such as a sash or a hair ribbon, your focus increases the duration of any enchantment spell you cast by 1 round (including spells that require concentration). Spells that require concentration also continue for 1 extra round after you stop concentrating. At 7th level, the duration bonuses each increase by 2 rounds. At 15th level, the DC of your enchantment spells increases by +2.

Evocation: Usually a bladed weapon, such as a longsword or dagger, your focus grants +1 point of damage to any evocation spell you cast. Non-area effect spells that allow multiple targets (such as magic missile) only deal the bonus damage to a single target of your choice. For example, a fireball spell cast by a 6th-level sorcerer with this focus deals 6d6+1 points of damage to all creatures caught within it, while a magic missile spell cast by the same sorcerer creates three missiles: two that deal 1d4+1 points of damage and one that deals 1d4+2 points of damage. At 7th level, evocation spells you cast ignore the first 5 points of any energy or elemental resistances that a creature may have. Immunities are not affected. At 15th level, you may, once per day, ignore a creature''s immunity when you cast an evocation spell that affects it.

Illusion: Usually a mask, shroud, cloak, or similar concealing piece of clothing, your focus increases the caster level of illusion spells you cast by +1. At 7th level, for every illusion spell you cast you gain a bonus on caster level checks made to defeat spell resistance equal to half your caster level. At 15th level, you may cast any personal illusion spell as a touch spell.

Necromancy: Usually a flail, kama, sickle, scythe, or other weapon derived from harvesting crops, your focus increases the range of any necromancy spell you cast by +25%. At 7th level, any necromancy spell you cast that deals ability damage, ability drain, or directly assigns a penally to an ability score deals +1 point of ability damage or ability drain or increases the penalty by an additional -1. For example, a 12th-level necromancer who casts ray of enfeeblement bestows a Strength penalty of 1d6+6 instead of the normal 1d6+5. At 15th level, any living creature affected by a necromancy spell you cast and fails the Fortitude save against it also becomes fatigued.

Transmutation: Usually a piece of equipment or set of tools used to create something (such as thieves'' tools, a musical instrument, or artisan''s tools), your focus grants any nonpersonal transmutation spell you cast with one or more targets one additional target. The additional target is affected by the spell for half the normal duration. At 7th level, the additional targets of your spells receive them for the full duration. At 15th level, once per day, a transmutation spell you cast that grants a bonus to ability scores doubles the bonus. For example, a bull''s strength spell grants a +8 bonus to Strength instead of the normal +4.


Focused Specialist
Every wizard who calls himself a specialist takes pride in wielding his preferred form of magic. Those who are exceptionally pure of purpose take this specialization to an entirely new level, disdaining breadth of skill in favor of even greater focus.

Class: Wizard.

Level: 1st.

Special Requirement: You must be a specialist wizard.

Replaces: You lose one spell slot from each level of wizard spells you can cast. If you later gain the ability to cast higher-level wizard spells, you lose one spell slot from each new level of spells you can cast.

You must also choose another prohibited school of magic, which can''t be divination.

Benefit: You can prepare two additional spells of your specialty school per spell level each day. These extra spells are in addition to those normally granted to a specialist wizard.

This benefit doesn''t apply to spells gained from classes other than wizard.

Gnome Illusionist
Gnomes are inherently drawn to the magic of illusion, and most gnome wizards choose to specialize in that school. As a gnome illusionist advances in level, her intimate familiarity with illusions allows her to cast certain illusion spells more easily than other wizards, to cast illusions that last longer than normal, and to make her spells harder to detect and dispel. These abilities make gnome illusionists the subtlest of all their kind and - some would argue - the most effective.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a gnome illusionist substitution level, a character must be a gnome about to take her 1st, 5th, or 10th level of illusionist.

Class Skills
Gnome illusionist substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier (or four times this number as a beginning character).


Table: Gnome Illusionist Racial Substitution Levels

Level	Base
Attack Bonus	Fort
Save	Ref
Save	Will
Save	Special	Spellcasting
1st	+0	+0	+0	+2	Gnome illusion spells, Scribe Scroll, summon familiar	Same as illusionist
5th	+2	+1	+1	+4	Extended illusions	Same as illusionist
10th	+5	+3	+3	+7	Insidious illusions	Same as illusionist
Class Features
All the following are features of the gnome illusionist''s racial substitution levels.

Gnome Illusion Spells: A gnome illusionist who takes the 1st-level racial substitution level uses her wizard level as the caster level for her racial spell-like abilities. In addition, she can prepare and cast the following illusion spells at the indicated spell level, rather than at their normal spell level:

0 level: Silent image, ventriloquism.

1st level: Leomund''s trap, minor image.

2nd level: Illusory script, major image.

3rd level: Illusory wall.

4th level: Persistent image.

5th level: Programmed image.

In exchange for this benefit, a gnome illusionist must choose one of the following schools of magic from which she can cast spells (in other words, one that she has not given up access to as the price for specializing in illusion): evocation, transmutation, or conjuration. The gnome illusionist''s effective caster level for spells of this school is equal to her actual caster level minus one. At 1st level, she cannot cast any spells from the selected school.

Extended Illusions (Su): A gnome illusionist who takes the 5th-level racial substitution level gains the ability to create illusions that last longer than normal. When she casts any illusion spell that has a duration other than instantaneous, the duration of the spell is doubled. A spell with a duration of concentration lasts for the duration of the illusionist''s concentration plus 1d4 rounds. A spell with a duration of concentration plus a certain increment of time lasts for the duration of the illusionist''s concentration plus double that increment of time. Thus, a mirror image spell cast by a 10th-level gnome illusionist lasts for 20 minutes, a silent image spell lasts for the duration of the caster''s concentration plus 1d4 rounds, a minor image spell lasts for the duration of the caster''s concentration plus 4 rounds, and a mirage arcana lasts for the duration of her concentration plus 20 hours.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard wizard at 5th level, as well as the two spells a standard 5thlevel wizard learns for free.

Insidious Illusions (Su): A gnome illusionist who takes the 10th-level racial substitution level can cast illusion spells that are harder for other creatures to detect or pierce. When any creature employs a divination spell, spell-like ability, or magic item (such as detect magic or true seeing) that would detect or pierce an illusion spell cast by the gnome illusionist, that creature must make a caster level check (DC 11 + the gnome illusionist''s caster level) to successfully detect or pierce the illusion. The detecting creature can check only once for each divination spell or effect used, no matter how many of the gnome illusionist''s illusion spells are operating in an area.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard wizard at 10th level, as well as the two spells a standard 10thlevel wizard learns for free.

Golarion Wizard
Wizards who train at the Arcanamirum spend much of their time studying the practical applications of their spells, often in the school''s dueling fields. As such, some of them have learned the above special ability, which replaces the Scribe Scroll feat gained at 1st level.

Arcane Duelist (Su): Wizards with this ability are specially trained to push their spells when needed to gain the upper hand. When pushing a spell, the wizard can choose one of the three following effects: increase a spell''s DC by +1, add +2 to the level check to overcome spell resistance, or add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls made with the spell. A wizard can use this ability a number of times per day equal to his Intelligence bonus. Using this ability is a swift action.

Halfling Wizard
Lacking the great colleges of wizardry in which human and elven wizards learn their craft, halflings master magic by practice, curiosity, and the random accumulation of knowledge. Halfling wizards gain a new form of versatility.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a halfling wizard substitution level, a character must be a halfling about to take her 3rd, 5th, or 12th level of wizard.

Class Skills
Halfling wizard substitution levels grant the same class skills as the standard wizard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

12th	+6/+1	+4	+4	+8	Greater alternative spell	Same as wizard
Class Features
All of the following are features of the halfling wizard''s racial substitution levels.

Alternative Spell (Ex): At 3rd level, the wizard gains a single spell known. This spell can be chosen from any 1st-level spell list, not just the wizard spell list. If this spell does not appear on the wizard spell list, treat the spell as 2nd level when prepared and cast by this wizard.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard''s two automatic spells learned.

Lore (Ex): At 5th level, the wizard knows legends or information regarding various topics, just as a bard can with bardic knowledge. She adds her wizard level and Intelligence modifier to the lore check, which otherwise functions like a bardic knowledge check.

This substitution replaces the wizard''s two automatic spells known and her bonus feat gained at 5th level.

Greater Alternative Spell (Ex): At 12th level, the wizard gains a single spell known. This spell can be chosen from any spell list, not just the wizard spell list, but it can be no higher than 5th level. If the spell appears on the wizard spell list she must learn it at the level it appears on that list, even if it appears at a lower level on another list. If this spell does not appear on the wizard spell list, treat the spell as one level higher when prepared and cast by this wizard.

This substitution feature replaces the standard wizard''s two automatic spells learned.

High One Warrior-Wizard
Some paladins of Azuth belong to the Order of the Swords of the High One. These rare warriors must progress as paladins before studying wizardry fulltime, since they cannot multiclass freely. This dual focus fuses their paladin training with their wizardry.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a level of High One warrior-wizard, a character must be a member of the Swords of the High One, have 1 rank in Knowledge (religion), have at least two paladin levels, and be about to take her 2nd, 4th, or 5th level of wizard.

Class Skills
High One warrior-wizards have all the class skills that a standard wizard does, plus Diplomacy, Handle Animal, Heal, and Ride.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All the following are features of the High One warrior-wizard substitution levels.

Wizardly Smiting (Su): At 2nd level, a High One warrior-wizard can smite evil as a paladin. Her wizard levels stack with her paladin levels for the purpose of determining how many times per day she can use this ability.

This benefit replaces the 1st-level spell that a standard wizard gains at 2nd level. From this point forward, the character has one fewer 1st-level spells that she can prepare per day than a standard wizard does.

Reduce Armor Hindrances (Ex): The High One warrior-wizard''s training in spellcasting allows her to ignore some of the hindrances of armor. The arcane spell failure chance imposed by her armor is reduced by 20% (minimum 0%). Thus, she can wear light armor without penalty, or medium or heavy armor with reduced penalties.

This benefit replaces the 2nd-level spell that a standard wizard gains at 4th level. From this point forward, the character has one fewer 2nd-level spells that she can prepare per day than a standard wizard does.

Familiar Mount: If a High One warrior-wizard has access to a special mount based on her paladin levels, this creature gains the characteristics of a familiar as well as those of a paladin mount. The High One warrior-wizard must dismiss her familiar (if she has one) to gain this benefit, but she takes no penalties for doing so. She then uses her wizard level to determine the natural armor bonus, Intelligence, and special abilities that her familiar should have and applies those to her special paladin mount. Her High One warriorwizard levels count as wizard levels for this purpose.

The mount''s natural armor bonuses from both sources stack, and it gains the greater of the two Intelligence scores. Thus, the mount has all the abilities of a special mount appropriate to the character''s paladin level and a familiar appropriate to her wizard level. Bonuses of the same type do not stack, except as noted above, and the mount cannot gain the same ability twice; it takes the better version to which it is entitled.

The High One warrior-wizard does not lose experience points if the familiar mount is killed because she can summon a new one according to the rules given for paladins.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat that a standard wizard gains at 5th level.


High Specialist
Because magic plays such an important role in the game, the wizard class offers great opportunities for change when designing a campaign or a character. The following variants present different versions of the standard specialist wizards. Each variant specialist class gives up one of the standard specialists class abilities in exchange for a new ability unique to the high specialist. Each specialist class has three variants: one that replaces the specialist''s summon familiar ability, one that replaces the specialist''s bonus feats, and one that replaces the specialist''s bonus spell per day from the specialty school.

Because each variant requires the loss of an existing ability, you can use more than one of these variants at the same time. By choosing among the variant abilities presented for each specialist, you can easily customize the way that magic works in a campaign, in a geographic region of a campaign, for a school of magic, or even for a single spellcaster. Players can easily create unique and interesting characters using these variants.

For example, a campaign might be set up with some or all of the following variants for specialist wizards.

All abjurers in the campaign have the resistance to energy variant ability because the setting includes a large number of gates to the elemental planes.
Evokers from a specific city all have the overcome resistance ability, but they do not gain additional spells as specialist wizards. However, other evokers in the campaign gain abilities exactly as standard evokers and consider the evokers of that city a disruptive offshoot of the pure study of magic.
The students and masters at a college of necromancy from a distant region slowly undergo undead apotheosis instead of gaining bonus feats, but most necromancers in the campaign gain abilities exactly as standard necromancers. This difference has led some to feel that the foreign necromancers have a more thorough understanding of the powers of death. Traditional necromancers have a hard time attracting students, while the foreigners gain several new apprentices each year.
One conjurer of particular power in the city cannot obtain a familiar and instead casts summoning spells exceptionally quickly, as described in the rapid summoning variant ability. He claims he can teach others to wield magic as he does, but so far he has gathered few students.
In addition to a description of the variant class''s abilities, each entry below includes brief suggestions on sample campaigns, adventures, or characters that might benefit from the use of the high specialists. These notes are suggestions only, since nearly any campaign can benefit from adding variety to spells and spellcasters.

Although these abilities allow the creation and customization of variant classes, a character cannot, for example, take a few levels of conjurer using the rapid summoning variant and then "multiclass" into regular conjurer levels. These variants all follow the normal rules for multiclassing by specialist wizards.

HIGH ABJURER
Masters of protective magic, abjurers can fill many roles in a campaign, from bodyguard to battlemage to adventurer. Although it lacks offensive options, the school of abjuration provides some of the most effective combat spells in the game. An evoker or transmuter might find it easier to bring down large groups of foes, but an abjurer is far more likely to bring herself and her companions through a fight alive.

In a campaign with a high degree of intrigue or political machinations, the protective abilities of an abjurer can guard against foes both obvious and unexpected, and rival groups of abjurers, all with slightly different powers, might vie for prominence among each nation''s schemers and courtiers. In combat-heavy campaigns, realms might employ abjuration specialists to protect against the battle magic of their rivals, and in any campaign, adventurers might come to rely on the skills of an abjurer to protect against the dangers of dungeon and wilderness.

Resistance to Energy (Su): Once per day, an abjurer using this variant can create a mystical shield that grants herself or any one creature that she touches limited protection against a chosen energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). The affected creature gains resistance equal to 5 plus one-half the abjurer''s class level against the chosen energy type. Activating this ability is a standard action. Once activated, the protection lasts for 1 hour. This protection overlaps with (and does not stack with) the effects of spells such as resist energy.

An abjurer using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Aura of Protection (Ex): Once per day, a 5th-level abjurer using this variant can generate a protective aura that shields against both physical and magical attacks. When the abjurer generates this field, she gains a deflection bonus to her Armor Class and a resistance bonus on all saving throws equal to her Intelligence modifier. This ability requires a standard action to activate, and each use protects against only one attack or spell. Once activated, the protective aura lasts for 1 minute or until the abjurer is attacked or required to make a saving throw, whichever comes first.

An abjurer using this variant can use this ability one additional time per day for every five class levels gained above 5th.

An abjurer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

Spontaneous Dispelling (Ex): At 5th level, an abjurer using this variant gains the ability to spontaneously cast the spell dispel magic. This ability is similar to the cleric''s ability to spontaneously cast cure spells, with a few exceptions. The abjurer can "lose" four or more levels of prepared spells to cast dispel magic. The prepared spells can be of any level or combination of levels as long as the total spell levels add up to four or more (0-level spells don''t count). For example, an abjurer using this variant could lose two 2nd-level spells or one 1st-level spell and one 3rd-level spell to cast dispel magic.

At 11th level, an abjurer can "lose" seven or more levels of prepared spells to spontaneously cast greater dispel magic.

An abjurer using this variant can use it in conjunction with a readied action to use dispel magic or greater dispel magic as a counterspell.

An abjurer using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

HIGH CONJURER
One of the most versatile schools of magic, conjuration offers its disciples an effective solution to nearly any task: simply summon the appropriate monster and let it solve the problem. In combat, high-level conjurers fight from behind wave after wave of summoned foes, and in most battles they simply direct their summoned allies into the conflict. In addition to these vaunted summoning powers, conjuration provides effective combat spells and access to teleportation magic.

While virtually any campaign can benefit from rival groups of conjurers serving diverse agendas, conjurers are particularly effective in combat-heavy campaigns. Campaigns that feature a great deal of long-distance travel or travel between planes also benefit from including diverse groups of conjurers, because their specialty facilitates travel and encourages a thorough understanding of the creatures of the Outer Planes.

Rapid Summoning (Ex): Any time a conjurer using this variant casts a summon monster spell, its casting time is 1 standard action rather than 1 full round. (Creatures so summoned can only take a standard action in the round they are summoned.) Conjurers using this variant gain the normal benefits from enhancing a summon monster spell with the Quicken Spell feat.

A conjurer using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Enhanced Summoning (Ex): At 1st level, a conjurer using this variant gains the Augment Summoning feat for free instead of the Scribe Scroll feat.

At 5th level, the conjurer''s summoned creatures become particularly tough to dispel. Add 2 to the DC of any caster level check made to dispel the conjurer''s summoned creatures. At 15th level, this addition to the DC increases to 4.

At 10th level, the conjurer''s summoned creatures gain an additional +2 bonus to Strength and Constitution. At 20th level, these bonuses increase to +4. These bonuses stack with those granted by the Augment Summoning feat.

A conjurer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

Spontaneous Summoning (Ex): Conjurers using this variant can "lose" a prepared spell to cast any summon monster spell of a lower level. For example, a conjurer who has prepared greater invisibility (a 4th-level spell) may lose that spell to cast summon monster I, summon monster II, or summon monster III.

A conjurer using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

Note: Since conjurers using this variant obviously summon monsters frequently, the game master should require the conjurer''s player to prepare simple record sheets ahead of time for each monster that the character commonly summons. It is also important to emphasize speedy play on the part of the conjurer and his summoned monsters.

HIGH DIVINER
Seekers of knowledge, hoarders of lore, and master spies, diviners are perhaps the most underrated specialist wizards. Because they must give up access to only one other school of magic, they are also the most versatile specialists. More than any other specialists, diviners excel at gathering information, and an adventuring party that includes a diviner is much more likely to prepare properly for an adventure.

Many campaigns benefit from featuring more than one type of divination specialist, and diviners can play important parts in any game revolving around information gathering. Campaigns that feature mysteries and detective-style adventures, themes of prophecy and oracles, or large amounts of social interaction and espionage all make excellent forums for a diviner''s powers. In campaigns that feature high diviners with different class abilities, one simple way to add more variety is to make each distinct group of specialists experts in and proponents of a different form of divination. In game terms, this divergence is represented by altering the material components for some divination spells. For example, one group of diviners might favor osteomancy and require a collection of bones to use as components for their spells.

Enhanced Awareness (Ex): A diviner using this variant adds Sense Motive to her list of class skills. In addition, she gains minor benefits when casting certain divination spells.

She needs only to study an item for 10 minutes (rather than 1 hour) when casting identify.

An arcane eye cast by the diviner travels at 20 feet per round when studying its surroundings (rather than 10 feet per round).

Add +1 to the saving throw DCs of the character''s divination spells. (This bonus stacks with the bonus from the Spell Focus and Greater Spell Focus feats.)

A diviner using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Bonus Feat List: A diviner using this variant gradually grows in awareness and perceptive ability, but at the expense of her metamagic capabilities. The diviner may not select a metamagic feat as a wizard bonus feat (that is, those feats gained at 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th level). However, the following feats are added to the list of bonus feats available to her at those levels: Alertness, Blind-Fight, Improved Initiative, Lightning Reflexes, and Skill Focus (Spot, Listen, or Sense Motive only).

Prescience (Ex): Gifted with extraordinary insight and perceptive abilities, a diviner using this variant can add an insight bonus equal to her Intelligence modifier to any attack roll, saving throw, skill check, or level check she makes. The diviner can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every five class levels attained. Using this ability is a free action that can be taken out of turn if needed, but the character must choose to use this ability before the die roll is made.

A diviner using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

HIGH ENCHANTER
Charmer, schemer, deceiver, pacifist: an enchanter can be all these and more. As a practitioner of one of the most subtle schools of magic, an enchanter might charm a guard into opening a well-defended gate that fifty warriors couldn''t take by force. Good-aligned enchanters use their powers to seek out truth and encourage others onto the path of good, while their evil counterparts bend others'' minds at their whim and gather personal power as rapidly as possible.

Campaigns that feature a large amount of social scenarios, political intrigue, or investigation benefit greatly from the inclusion of high enchanters. These spellcasters, skilled in the manipulation of others and capable of concealing their own identities, make excellent villains and manipulators, or even investigators skilled at using magic to draw the truth out of opponents.

Players and game masters alike should also consider the ramifications that enchantment spells and similar effects have on a game world. Is casting charm person legal? Is a character legally responsible for actions taken while charmed? Do most of the campaign''s inhabitants know that enchantment effects exist? Are there folk remedies that supposedly provide protection against enchantment effects? Do they actually work? Having ready answers to these and similar questions not only adds consistency to the game, but also clarifies and highlights the role of the enchanter.

Cohort: Upon reaching 6th level, an enchanter using this variant gains the service of a loyal cohort of the player''s choice (with the game master''s approval). The cohort is a 4th-level character when first gained; after that point, follow the normal rules described in the Leadership feat to determine the cohort''s level, but treat the enchanter''s level as being two lower than normal.

The enchanter doesn''t gain any followers from this ability. If the enchanter selects the Leadership feat, he attracts followers as normal, the penalty to the enchanter''s effective level is eliminated, and the enchanter automatically qualifies for the "special power" modifier to his Leadership score.

An enchanter using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Social Proficiency (Ex): Enchanters using this variant are as proficient at manipulating others through mundane means as they are at influencing their minds magically. Add the following skills to the character''s list of wizard class skills: Bluff, Diplomacy, Gather Information, Intimidate, and Sense Motive. The enchanter also gains a +2 competence bonus on checks involving one of these skills (player''s choice) every five levels (5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th). This bonus can only be applied once to each skill.

An enchanter using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

Extended Enchantment (Su): Enchanters using this variant ensnare the minds of others more easily with their magic, and as a result their enchantment spells last longer than those cast by other spellcasters. Once per day, plus one additional time per two class levels gained above 1st, an enchanter using this variant can cast a spell from the enchantment school as if it were enhanced by the Extend Spell metamagic feat. This enhancement does not affect the spell''s level.

This ability cannot be used to extend a spell with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, or permanent.

An enchanter using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

HIGH EVOKER
Masters of the raw power of magical energy, evokers can turn the tide of a battle with a single powerful spell, leveling groups of foes faster than any other practitioner of magic. Where some wizards focus on careful spell preparation and protective spells to survive combat encounters, evokers simply blast away with powerful energy attacks. Their prodigious offensive abilities ensure that evokers become the center of an adventuring group''s battle plan.

Campaigns that include large numbers of wizards aligned to different nations are particularly suitable for high evokers, since each nation develops unique cadres of evokers to serve in battle. Groups of militant evokers marching in unison with more conventional groups can change the tide of nearly any battle. In addition, campaigns that include themes of primal energy, raw nature, or extreme elemental conditions can all benefit from introducing evokers with variant abilities. Evokers in these sorts of campaigns might explore the raw essence of magic, struggling to harness its energies in new and unique ways.

Energy Affinity (Ex): Evokers using this variant must choose an energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic). This choice is made upon character creation and cannot be altered thereafter. Any time the character casts an evocation spell with the chosen energy type, she casts the spell as if her caster level were one higher (affecting range, duration, damage, caster level checks, and any other factor influenced by caster level).

An evoker using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Energy Substitution (Ex): An evoker of 5th level or higher using this variant can substitute energy of one type for another. When casting a spell that has an energy descriptor (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the evoker can change the energy descriptor and the spell''s effects to energy of a different type.

Using this ability is a free action that must be declared before the spell is cast. The evoker can use this ability once per day for each five class levels he has attained (1/day at 5th, 2/day at 10th, and so on).

An evoker using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

Overcome Resistance (Ex): The energy spells of an evoker using this variant can ignore some or all of a target''s resistance to energy. Using this ability is a free action that must be announced before the evoker casts the spell to be affected. Every creature affected by the spell is treated as if its resistance to the spell''s energy type was 10 points lower, to a minimum of 0. (This lowered resistance applies only to this spell; other effects with the same energy descriptor must get through the creature''s normal resistance.)

The overcome resistance ability does not give the affected spell any ability to affect creatures with immunity to the spell''s energy type, nor does the affected spell have any additional effect on creatures that do not have resistance to energy.

An evoker may use this ability one time per day, plus one additional time per day for every two class levels attained beyond 1st (2/day at 3rd, 3/day at 5th, and so forth).

An evoker using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.


HIGH ILLUSIONIST
Illusionists control their surroundings by shaping, distorting, and deceiving the perceptions of others. To some their abilities seem weak, because they only distort and disguise rather than effecting true change, but those affected by an illusionist''s spells know better, understanding that their own senses can be turned against them at any time.

Campaigns that deal in deception or that have a high level of social interaction, a fair number of mystery adventures, or even simply suspicious players can benefit from the introduction of high illusionists. Campaigns featuring multiple types of high illusionists might give each group or variant an even more distinctive flavor by making each the master of a particular subset of illusion spells. Illusionists from one nation might, for example, have the chains of disbelief variant ability and favor phantasms, while the illusionist thieves of the Guild of Shadows might have the shadow shaper variant ability and favor glamers and shadow magic.

Chains of Disbelief (Ex): Even if a viewer disbelieves an illusion created by an illusionist using this variant and communicates the details of the illusion to other creatures, those other creatures do not receive the normal +4 bonus on their saying throws to disbelieve the illusion. Furthermore, even when presented with incontrovertible proof that the illusion isn''t real, creatures must still succeed on a Will saving throw to see objects or creatures that the illusion obscures, although they get a +10 bonus on the saving throw.

An illusionist using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Shadow Shaper: An illusionist using this variant has a special bond with the Plane of Shadow, and gains several special abilities as he advances in level.

At 1st level, Hide is treated as a class skill for the illusionist.

At 5th level, the illusionist may add his Intelligence modifier (in addition to his Dexterity modifier) to his Hide skill checks.

At 10th level the illusionist''s illusions become infused with shadow stuff from the Plane of shadow, making them more realistic and more likely to fool the senses. The save DCs of the illusionist''s illusion spells increase by +1. This benefit stacks with similar bonuses, such as from Spell Focus.

At 15th level, the illusionist can hide in plain sight (as the ranger ability, except that the illusionist need not be in natural terrain).

At 20th level, the illusionist gains the ability to blend into shadows. In any condition of illumination that would normally grant the illusionist concealment, he instead gains total concealment (as if he were invisible).

An illusionist using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

Illusion Mastery (Ex): An illusionist using this variant automatically adds two illusion spells to his spellbook every time he gains a level that grants access to a new spell level. Furthermore, any time the illusionist learns a new illusion spell, he treats that spell as if be had mastered it with the Spell Mastery feat.

An illusionist using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

HIGH NECROMANCER
Wrapped in mystery and burdened by reputations of evil, necromancers control dangerous energies that rob the living of strength and grant unlife to the dead. The most powerful necromancers command dangerous undead minions and threaten towns, cities, and sometimes even entire kingdoms with their power. Although necromancers make excellent villains and nemeses for a group of adventurers, neutral- and good-aligned necromancers who view themselves as the shepherds of the living and guardians of the dead can also prove valuable allies.

Campaigns that include evil necromancers or groups of undead as antagonists can benefit from the inclusion of high necromancers. Rival groups of necromancers might view certain types of undead as the only true or "pure" undead and all others as evils that must be destroyed, with each group disagreeing on which types are which. Other factions or groups might have an innate loathing for undead raised by any but themselves.

Skeletal Minion: A 1st-level necromancer using this variant can begin play with an undead minion (a human warrior skeleton). Obtaining this minion takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp.

This creature is a loyal servant that follows the necromancer''s commands and accompanies her on adventures if desired. If the skeletal minion is destroyed, the necromancer suffers no ill effects and may replace it by performing a ceremony identical to the one that allowed her to obtain her first servant.

At 1st level, the skeleton is completely typical, but it gains power as the necromancer gains levels. The skeleton has a number of Hit Dice equal to the necromancer''s class level. Add one-half the necromancer''s class level to the skeleton''s natural armor bonus. Add one-third of the necromancer''s class level to the skeleton''s Strength and Dexterity scores.

A necromancer using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Undead Apotheosis (Ex): As a necromancer using this variant progresses in levels, she gains some of the qualities that typify undead creatures.

At 5th level, the necromancer gains a 2 bonus on all saving throws made to resist sleep, stun, paralysis, poison, or disease. This bonus increases to +4 at 15th level.

At 10th level, the necromancer gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made to resist ability damage, ability drain, or energy drain.

At 20th level, the necromancer gains 25% resistance to critical hits, as the light fortification armor special ability.

A necromancer using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

Enhanced Undead (Ex): Any time a necromancer using this variant creates an undead creature (such as with animate dead, create undead, or create greater undead), all undead creatures created gain a +4 enhancement bonus to Strength and Dexterity, and two additional hit points per Hit Die. This ability does not affect the number or Hit Dice of animated creatures that the necromancer can create or control.

A necromancer using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

HIGH TRANSMUTER
Masters of change, transmuters are among the most varied and versatile specialists. Transmutation spells, by their very nature, can change the environment and allow the spellcaster to solve nearly any problem.

This school''s utility and variety ensures that nearly any campaign''s magic becomes richer with the introduction of high transmuters. Campaigns in which the magic system is undergoing change benefit from introducing high transmuters. Likewise, campaigns that include an above-average number of magical cultures or a long history of magical sophistication benefit from alternative traditions of transmutation magic.

Enhance Attribute (Ex): Once per day, plus one additional time per five class levels, a transmuter using this variant can add a +2 enhancement bonus to any one of his ability scores. This bonus lasts for a number of minutes equal to the transmuter''s class level. Using this ability is a free action (and counts as using a quickened spell, so it may only be used once per round).

A transmuter using this variant permanently gives up the ability to obtain a familiar.

Spell Versatility (Ex): A 5th-level transmuter using this variant can adapt magic of other schools to his own style of spellcasting. For every five class levels that the transmuter gains, he can select one spell of any spell level that he has access to and treat it as if it were a transmutation spell. This means, for example, that the specialist can learn the spell normally and even prepare it as a bonus spell from the transmutation school. This spell can even be from a school that he has chosen as a prohibited school. Once a spell is chosen to be affected by this ability, it cannot be changed.

For example, a transmutation specialist using this variant has selected abjuration and necromancy as his prohibited schools. At 5th level, he gains access to 3rd-level spells. He chooses dispel magic and forever after treats dispel magic as if were a transmutation spell.

A transmuter using this variant does not gain bonus feats for advancing as a wizard.

Transmutable Memory (Ex): A transmuter using this variant can alter some of his prepared spells in a short amount of time. Once per day, the transmuter can give up a number of prepared spell levels (up to a maximum total equal to half his class level) and prepare different spells in their place, as long as the number of newly prepared spell levels is equal to or less than the number of spell levels given up (0-level spells don''t count). For example, a 12th-level transmuter who uses this variant can lose two 1st-level spells and two 2nd-level spells from memory (a total of six spell levels, half the character''s class level) and prepare two 3rd-level spells.

Using this ability requires a number of minutes of concentration equal to the number of spell levels given up. if the transmuter''s concentration is broken during this time, all spells to be lost are gone and no spells are gained in their place.

A transmuter using this variant does not gain additional spells per day for being a specialist wizard.

Imbued Staff
As an optional rule, any sorcerer or wizard may opt to forego a normal familiar in order to imbue her traveling staff with that portion of her power. To do this, she selects a quarterstaff-length of wood that resonates with her mystical signature and personality. It cannot have been previously enchanted (although it may subsequently be) and must be of masterwork quality. It must be prepared using materials costing at least 500 gp, usually with a gem to serve as a mounted finial. The imbuing ritual takes 24 hours and ties a portion of the spellcaster''s power into the staff, a separate piece of her soul that grows in power as she does. Upon its imbuing, the staff becomes magically linked to its creator and is treated as a magic item.

Hit Points: The staff has 10 Hit Points and Hardness 5, both of which increase as the wizard or sorcerer gains levels, according to the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

Saving Throws: The staff saves as its creator, even when unattended.

If an imbued staff is broken, its creator must attempt a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or lose 500 experience points per wizard or sorcerer level. Success reduces the loss by half. However, a caster''s experience point total can never be reduced below 0 as a result of the loss of her staff. A broken imbued staff cannot be replaced for a year and a day - the loss is too great.

If the character who imbued the staff dies, the staff loses all magical properties. Should the character return from the grave, it regains its imbued powers when it is first touched by the imbuing character.

Table: Imbued Staff Advancement

Master
Class Level	Hardness	Hit Points	Special
1st-2nd	5	15	Cantrips, deliver touch spells
3rd-4th	5	15	Enhanced weapon +1
5th-6th	5	15	Remote viewing

Imbued Ability Descriptions
An imbued staff has special capabilities depending on its master''s wizard or sorcerer level, as shown on the Imbued Staff Advancement table.

Cantrips (Sp): Three times per day, as a standard action, the wielder of the staff can make it shed a flickering light as per the spell. Once activated, this light remains until the wielder dismisses it (a free action). In addition, the staff can hold a single cantrip available to the wielder, decided upon when it is first imbued. Once per day, as a standard action, the master can cast this cantrip from the staff. The caster level for these effects is equal to that of the master. The save DC for any cantrip cast by the staff is 10.

Deliver Touch Spells (Su): The master may deliver touch spells with the staff. When using the staff in this way, the wielder may attempt to deal the staffs damage by hitting the target''s standard AC (as opposed to the target''s touch AC). A successful critical hit with the staff does not double the spell''s affect when delivered in this way.

Enhanced Weapon (Su): The staff gains the listed enhancement bonus to attack and damage when wielded by its master. This bonus applies to both ends of the staff. In the hands of any other it is merely an ordinary masterwork staff.

Remote Viewing (Su): The staff''s master may concentrate and view the staff''s surroundings as though looking through the finial. This effect is identical to that of clairvoyance except that it lasts for as long as the owner concentrates and has an infinite range so long as the staff is on the same plane. While in effect, the staff''s finial glows faintly, illuminating the area around the staff like a candle.

Vital Transfer (Su): The staff''s master may opt to forego her natural healing for the evening and mend her staff through mystical means. Each night''s rest thus spent returns a number of hit points to the staff equal to the master''s character level, up to the staff''s maximum hit points. The Heal skill does not increase this amount.

Perfect Location (Su): By concentrating for a full round, the wizard knows the direction and distance to her staff, so long as it is on the same plane.

Mighty Weapon (Su): The staff gains the bane, defending, flaming, frost, merciful, shock, or thundering special weapon ability. This ability applies to both ends of the staff. Once chosen, the bonus cannot be changed and does not function in the hands of anyone other than the staff''s master.

Return (Su): The master can summon the staff to her hand as a standard action, so long as it is on the same plane. When summoned in this way, the staff simply appears in its master''s hand. Any effect targeting the staff or the master that prevents teleportation also blocks this ability.

Invested Symbol of Power
Once a staff has been imbued with a wizard''s power, the spellcaster can further enhance it through feats like Enchant Staff, Imbued Defense, Imbued Strength, Invest Spell, and Recharge Staff. These feats each require further preparation and ornamentation of the staff, and as such are classified as item creation feats.

Enhancing an Imbued Staff
A wizard with the Craft Staff feat wishing to add powers to her imbued staff as if it were a normal staff may do so, however all costs associated with its creation are increased by 20%. This reflects the difficulty in overlaying the newer abilities with the existing powers. A staff crafted in this manner is created with 50 charges. It retains any imbued powers and its magical nature, even after the charges are expended.


Immediate Magic
Other than having a single additional spell of each spell level, a specialist wizard functions like any other wizard. Your evoker''s fireball spell deals as much damage as that of a conjurer, diviner, or necromancer, and doesn''t look any different. By taking the immediate magic alternative class feature, you gain a useful trick that sets you apart from other specialists. Though giving up your familiar is a hardship, it means you have one less thing to worry about in a fight.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: You gain a supernatural ability that reflects your chosen school of magic. Activating this ability is an immediate action, and you can use this supernatural ability a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum 1). Its equivalent spell level is equal to one-half your wizard level (minimum 1st), and the caster level is your wizard level. The save DC (if any) is equal to 10 + 1/2 your wizard level + your Int modifier.

You can''t activate this ability in response to an attack that you aren''t aware of. For instance, if an invisible rogue strikes at you, you can''t activate urgent shield to gain a bonus to your AC against the attack. All effects last until the start of your next turn unless otherwise noted.

To select this ability, you must also choose to specialize in a school of magic. The supernatural ability gained depends on your specialty (see below).

Urgent Shield (abjuration): You create a temporary shield of force that grants you a +2 shield bonus to AC.

Abrupt Jaunt (conjuration): You teleport up to 10 feet. You can''t bring along any other creatures.

Glimpse Peril (divination): You get a flash of foresight into the danger lying in your future. You gain a +2 insight bonus on the next saving throw you make before your next turn.

Instant Daze (enchantment): When an enemy that has HD equal to or less than your wizard level makes a melee attack against you, you can render him dazed (Will negates). This is a compulsion, mind-affecting ability.

Counterfire (evocation): When a visible enemy within 60 feet targets you with a ranged attack or spell, you can respond with a glowing arrow of force. This requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 1d6 points of damage per three wizard levels. Both attacks resolve simultaneously (neither can disrupt the other).

Brief Figment (illusion): You create a figment double of yourself (similar to mirror image). The image lasts until it is struck or until the start of your next turn.

Cursed Glance (necromancy): When a visible enemy within 60 feet targets you with an attack or spell, you can respond with a curse. If the enemy fails a Will save, he takes a -2 penalty to AC and on saving throws.

Sudden Shift (transmutation): You temporarily change your form to grant yourself a climb, fly, or swim speed equal to your current land speed. If you activate this ability during your turn, it lasts until the end of that turn; otherwise it lasts until the end of your next turn.

Impromptu Metamagic
Sorcerers typically seek to maximize their limited spell selection by utilizing metamagic feats. Other arcane spellcasters also adjust their spells with these feats in order to keep their enemies guessing or to find added flexibility for their lower-level spells. This ability allows you to spontaneously apply metamagic feats to your spells.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Each day, you may choose a metamagic feat you have. You can cast spells affected by that feat without increasing the spell level or casting time of the spells. You may not use any other metamagic feats that day. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 5 minus the level adjustment of the metamagic feat. (Thus, you may use Quicken Spell in this way once per day, while you could use Silent Spell four times per day.)

You may apply the metamagic feat spontaneously, as you cast the spell. If you prepare spells, you do not need to prepare the spells with the metamagic feat already applied.

Even though this ability does not increase the spell''s level, you must be able to cast spells of the level the spell would be if you applied the metamagic feat normally. For example, a quickened magic missile would normally require a 5th-level spell slot. With this ability you may cast a quickened magic missile as a 1st-level spell, but you must still be able to cast 5th-level spells.

Planar Wizard
While other spellcasters may have a vested interest in a particular planar viewpoint, the wizard prefers a more open policy toward the planes. To a wizard, the planes represent knowledge and power, and the wizard who can learn the secrets of the planes without regard to those planes'' alignments or other traits is a true master of magic.

More so than many other classes, the wizard already has the ability to customize her abilities with an eye to the planes, simply through the spells she learns and prepares each day. If a wizard learns plane shift and planar tolerance, then the caster is self-customized to adventure on the planes. But the planar wizard goes a step beyond this adaptation, learning to channel the pure power of the planes themselves in her spells.

Hit Die: d4.

Requirements
To take a wizard planar substitution level, a character must be about to take her 6th, 10th, or 14th level of wizard.

The character must also fulfill any one of the following criteria:

* Have 1 rank in Knowledge (the planes).

* Have a heritage feat.

* Have the extraplanar subtype when on the Material Plane.

* Have visited a plane other than the Material Plane.

Class Skills
Wizard planar substitution levels have the class skills of the standard wizard class.

Skill Points at Each Level: 2 + Int modifier.

Class Features
All of the following are features of the wizard''s planar substitution levels.

Unimpeded Magic (Su): A 6th-level planar wizard learns to overcome planar impediments to her spellcasting. When casting a wizard spell that would normally be impeded because of a plane''s magic traits (such as a fire spell on the Elemental Plane of Water), the spell functions normally without need for a Spellcraft check.

This benefit replaces the 3rd-level spell slot gained by a standard wizard at 6th level. From now on, the wizard can prepare one less 3rd-level wizard spell than indicated on Table: The Wizard.

Planar Spellcasting (Su): A 10th-level planar wizard learns to channel planar energy through her spells. Upon gaining this ability, the wizard chooses to make her spells anarchic (chaotic), axiomatic (lawful), celestial (good), or fiendish (evil). Her spells gain the indicated alignment descriptor. The wizard can choose any of the four options, regardless of her own alignment. Against creatures of the opposed alignment, she gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks made to overcome spell resistance, and her spell save DCs are increased by 1. If she casts a spell that normally has the same alignment descriptor that she would apply, or whenever she casts a spell on a plane with an alignment trait that matches the alignment she chose, the bonuses increase to +2. These effects apply only to the character''s wizard spells; any spellcasting ability gained from another class functions normally.

For example, the spells of a wizard choosing to cast fiendish spells gain the evil descriptor. She gains a +1 bonus on caster level checks to overcome the spell resistance of good-aligned creatures, and good-aligned creatures attempting to save against her spells do so against a DC that is 1 higher than normal. If she casts a spell that would normally be an evil spell (such as contagion), or if she casts any spell on an evil-aligned plane (such as the Abyss or the Nine Hells), these values would increase by 2 instead of by 1.

This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a standard wizard at 10th level, as well as the two spells a standard 10th-level wizard learns for free.

Enhanced Magic (Su): A 14th-level planar wizard learns how to channel the essence of a specific plane''s enhanced magic trait through her spells. Upon gaining this ability, the wizard must choose a specific plane that she has visited (other than the Material Plane). Three times per day, the wizard may spend a standard action to channel that plane''s magical essence. The next spell she casts (if cast within 1 minute) is enhanced as if she were casting it on that plane, applying any magic traits normal to that plane. This ability doesn''t apply any other planar magic traits to the wizard''s spells, such as wild magic or impeded magic.

For example, a planar wizard who chose to channel the essence of the Elemental Plane of Fire would maximize and enlarge the next spell she cast after activating this ability (as if she had applied the Maximize Spell and Enlarge Spell meta magic feats, but without adjusting the spell slot used), as long as that spell has the fire descriptor.

This benefit replaces the 7th-level spell slot gained by a standard wizard at 14th level. From now on, the wizard can prepare one less 7th-level wizard spell than indicated on Table: The Wizard.

School Mastery
Some specialist wizards take their mastery to whole new levels. Occasionally, even sorcerers and other arcane spellcasters focus their attentions on one school over the others. Your expertise in a chosen school of magic is unparalleled.

Level: 1st (4th for hexblades).

Replaces: If you select this class feature you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: Choose a school of magic. If you are already a specialist wizard, you may only choose the school in which you are specialized. You cast all spells from the chosen school at +1 caster level. In addition, you gain the following benefit, based on the school you select.

Abjuration: Any non-instantaneous, nonpermanent abjuration spell you cast on someone other than yourself that does not require concentration has double the duration. You cannot use this ability on any spell whose duration you affect in any other way, such as with the Extend Spell metamagic feat.

Conjuration: Each creature you conjure with any summon spell gains a +2 enhancement bonus to Dexterity and Wisdom for the duration of the spell that summoned it.

Divination: Whenever you cast a divination spell, you immediately gain a +2 insight bonus on Listen and Spot skill checks for 1 hour per level of the spell you cast (0-level spells grant the bonus for 30 minutes).

Enchantment: For 24 hours after an enchantment spell you cast expires, the target of your spell takes a -2 penalty on all Will saves made to resist your spells or spell-like abilities. You may affect only one creature at a time in this way. If your enchantment spell affected multiple targets, you must choose one creature against whom the penalty applies. Whenever an enchantment spell you cast expires while such a penally is active, the old penalty immediately disappears.

Evocation: Whenever you cast an evocation spell that deals hit point damage, that spell deals +1 point of damage.

Illusion: Whenever you cast an illusion (shadow) spell that creates a partially real effect (such as shadow conjuration or shadow evocation), the effect is 10% more real than normal. Thus, a creature created by shadow conjuration is 30% as strong as a real creature of the same kind, instead of the normal 20%.

Necromancy: Each undead creature you create with any evil spell gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your caster level. These temporary hit points last indefinitely, only disappearing when your creation takes damage. They cannot be regained once lost.

Transmutation: Whenever you cast a spell that alters a creature''s form, kind, or type, the DC to resist the spell increases by +1.

Soul Reaper
Most necromancers care little for the living, regarding them at best as potential sources of new undead servitors and at worst as inconvenient meddlers. The soul reaper takes a radically different approach. Rather than use her magic to expand the power of death, she crafts spells to breach the barrier between the living and the dead. By peering into the cosmic ether, the soul reaper can snatch a creature''s spirit in the split second that it hovers between the material world and the afterlife.

By collecting souls in this manner and using obscene rituals to torment and enslave them, the soul reaper can expand her arcane power and conquer her enemies more easily. For this reason, she is perhaps the most feared of the dark magi. A fleshcrafter may kill one or more victims to produce a new servant, but the creature so formed is only an animated physical shell - the life forces of the victims themselves pass on to the afterlife. Other necromancers traffic with evil spirits and mindless undead, but only the soul reaper routinely denies her victims their final reward. Trapped within her service, suspended between life and death, they endure a terrible, lonely existence in which they cater to the whims of a power-hungry wizard. When a diabolical fiend must permanently remove an opponent, he calls upon a soul reaper to trap his foe''s spirit. Even a cleric''s power to raise the dead fails to function on a soul trapped within a ruby that a soul reaper has tossed into the sea.

Alignment: Any evil.

Hit Die: d4.

Class Skills
The soul reaper''s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are Concentration (Con), Craft (Int), Knowledge (all skills, taken individually) (Int), Profession (Wis), and Spellcraft (Int).

Skill Points at 1st Level: (2 + Int modifier) x 4.

Skill Points at Each Additional Level: 2 + Int modifier.

1 In addition to the stated number of spells per day for 0- through 9th-level spells, a soul reaper gets a bonus necromancy spell for each spell level for specializing in the necromancy school. The "+1" in the entries on this table represents that spell. Bonus necromancy spells are in addition to any bonus spells the soul reaper may receive for having a high Intelligence score.
Class Features
All of the following are class features of the soul reaper.

Weapon and Armor Proficiency: Like most arcane spellcasters, a soul reaper receives only minimal training with weapons and none with armor. She is proficient with the club, dagger, heavy crossbow, light crossbow, and quarterstaff, but not with any type of armor or shield. Armor of any type interferes with a soul reaper''s movements, which can cause spells with somatic components to fail.

Spells: A soul reaper casts arcane spells, which are drawn from the sorcerer/wizard spell list in the Player''s Handbook. She must choose and prepare her spells ahead of time, like a wizard. To learn, prepare, or cast a spell, a soul reaper must have an Intelligence score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a soul reaper''s spell is 10 + the spell level the soul reaper''s Intelligence modifier.

Like a wizard, a soul reaper can cast only a certain number of arcane spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on the table for her class. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high Intelligence score.

All soul reapers function as necromancer specialist wizards for the purpose of spellcasting. They must specialize in necromancy and choose prohibited schools as per the standard rules for specialist wizards.

Spellbooks: A soul reaper must record her spells in thick books. Each morning, she pores over these tomes to prepare her spells for use later in the day. The soul reaper can prepare read magic from memory, but all other spells must appear in her spellbooks before she can prepare them. A soul reaper gains all 0-level wizard spells (except for those from prohibited schools) at 1st level. In addition, she gains three 1st-level spells and an additional number equal to her Intelligence bonus. Thereafter, each time the soul reaper achieves a new level, she gains two new spells of any level or levels that her new level allows him to cast.

Like a wizard, a soul reaper may select the Spell Mastery feat.

Inquisitor of the Grave (Sp): At 1st level, the soul reaper learns to force information from the recently departed soul of a fresh corpse. Once per day, the soul reaper can use speak with dead as a spell-like ability, duplicating the effects of the speak with dead spell. The soul reaper must follow all the guidelines and restrictions associated with casting that spell.

Spiritual Vassal: The soul reaper can compel obedience from a host of spirits that she has seized through a foul ceremony and combined into a single spiritual vassal. This ghostly apparition has little effect on the physical world, but besides acting as a familiar, it grants the reaper some of the knowledge the souls used to create it held in life.

A soul reaper dominates and controls the spirits that make up the vassal through a vile ritual that requires 100 gp worth of materials (primarily blood and bone taken from outsiders) and a humanoid creature slain via a ritual sacrifice. After killing her victim, the soul reaper can open a magical link to the afterlife, compel a number of minor spirits to enter the material world, and force them into her service. These spirits combine to form a single entity known as a spiritual vassal that obeys the soul reaper''s every command - primarily because it faces terrible repercussions if it refuses to do so. As a free action, a soul reaper can induce wracking agony in her vassal, causing it to howl in pain. The pain immobilizes the vassal (no save) until the reaper wills the effect to end (also a free action). This pitiable creature might moan for an end to its horrid existence even as it moves to oppose the soul reaper''s foes.

While the spiritual vassal serves the soul reaper, it is as loyal and trustworthy as a standard wizard''s familiar. If it is destroyed, the soul reaper suffers the same drawbacks as a wizard does if her familiar is slain. The spiritual vassal gains all the abilities indicated on the Spiritual Vassal Special Abilities table, based on its master''s level. Many of these are the standard abilities of a familiar, but a few are unique to the spiritual vassal. The spiritual vassal also gains all the abilities described under "Familiar Basics" in the Familiars section. Spiritual vassals are rarely encountered without a master. The statistics provided here, for an unbonded vassal, should only actually be used if the vassal''s master is slain and it manages to survive. Unbonded vassals constantly whimper and softly moan of their despair, begging any creatures they encounter to end their miserable existence and send the souls trapped in their bodies back to the afterlife.

Spiritual Vassal (unbonded): CR -; Tiny undead; HD 1/2d12; hp 3; Init +1; Spd 10 ft., fly 30 ft. (perfect); AC 14 (+2 size, +1 Dex, +1 natural armor), touch 13, flat-footed 13; BAB +0, Grp -8; Atk +1 melee (1-1, slam); Full Atk +1 melee (1-1, slam); SA -; SQ undead traits; AL N: SV Fort +0, Ref +1, Will +3; Str 8, Dex 12, Con -, Int 10, Wis 12, Cha 10.

A spiritual vassal looks like a small sphere of pale, glowing light. Those unfamiliar with soul reapers and their servants might mistake one for a will-o''-wisp. When in combat or forced to perform some other unpleasant task, spiritual vassals moan in inarticulate whispers of their pain and misery. Up close, shadowy faces - the spirits of the unfortunate souls bound into the vassal - occasionally appear and fade on the surface of the orb.

Ancestral Knowledge (Sp): The spiritual vassal can draw on its memories from life to provide the reaper with advice, skills, and abilities on a temporary basis. Starting at 5th level, the soul reaper can access her spiritual vassal''s memories, gaining one of the abilities described below (reaper''s choice) once per day. She gains one additional selection per day at 9th level, another at 13th level, and a fourth at 17th level. The soul reaper may mix and match the abilities as desired within her usage allotment. For example, a 17th-level soul reaper could use the memories of past lives ability four times, or memories of past lives twice and talents of the elders twice, or any combination of the three abilities that adds up to four uses. The reaper''s spiritual vassal must be able to communicate with her for this ability to function.

Memories of Past Lives: Drawing on her spiritual vassal''s memories, the soul reaper gains a +5 competence bonus on checks made with a skill of her choice. This bonus lasts for 1 minute.

Speech of the Ancients: The soul reaper gains the ability to speak and read a language of her choice for 1 minute.

Talents of the Elders: The soul reaper gains temporary access to a feat of her choice for which she meets the prerequisites. She can use the feat for 1 minute.

Bind Spirit (Su): At 5th level, the soul reaper may attempt to capture the spirit of a dying creature in a gem or crystal worth at least 500 gp. This entrapment requires a standard action, and the soul reaper must ready her action to use it at the moment her victim reaches -10 hit points or is destroyed. The victim may attempt a Will save (DC 15 + the soul reaper''s Intelligence modifier) to resist the binding. On a failed save, the victim''s spirit is trapped in the gem, where it must remain for 1 day per level the soul reaper possesses in this class, or until the gem is broken or destroyed. As long as the soul is in the gem, the victim cannot be restored to life in any manner. The victim''s soul cannot be communicated with or contacted in any way, with the exception of the soul reaper abilities described below.

The soul reaper can choose to use any one of the following benefits once per day while the soul is within the gem.

Compel the bound soul to answer one yes or no question truthfully.
Speak any one language the bound soul knows for 1 hour.
Choose any one skill the bound soul possesses and use its ranks in that skill in place of her own for 1 minute. The soul reaper is considered trained in the use of the skill.
Whether or not the reaper actually uses one of these options, the soul is automatically released at the end of the ability''s duration. If the gem or crystal is destroyed, the soul is freed immediately.

Bonus Feat: At 10th level, the soul reaper gains a bonus feat. She may choose any metamagic, item creation, or necromantic feat for which she meets the prerequisites. She gains another such bonus feat at 20th level.

Spawn Undead Servitor: At 15th level, the soul reaper gains the dreaded ability to force a soul captured via her bind spirit ability to inhabit the body of a skeleton or zombie. By completing a ritual that costs 500 gp per Hit Die of the skeleton or zombie, the reaper can permanently grant it the trapped soul''s base attack bonus (if higher than its current one), skill ranks, weapon proficiencies, armor proficiencies, and feats. In addition, the undead creature gains the victim''s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. Other abilities, such as class abilities, special attacks, and special qualities, cannot be transferred in this manner.

This process creates a corrupted, twisted version of the original soul with the soul reaper''s alignment in the undead creature. Once the ritual is complete, the trapped soul used in the ritual is freed and moves on to the afterlife normally. The reaper gains no special control over undead creatures created in this way unless she already commands them. For purposes of turning or rebuking undead, an undead servitor counts as 1.5 times its actual Hit Dice. Its challenge rating equals its base CR plus 1/4 of the CR of the bound spirit used in the ritual.

Spontaneous Divination
You can use your connection to the divine to inquire about mysteries beyond mortal ken.

Level: 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th.

Replaces: This benefit replaces the bonus feat gained by a wizard at 5th, 10th, 15th, or 20th level.

Benefit: You can spontaneously cast any spell you know from the divination school by sacrificing a prepared spell of equal or greater level. For example, if you suddenly have need of the 2nd-level spell locate object, you can sacrifice a prepared 2nd-level spell (such as mirror image) or any prepared spell of a higher level to cast it on the spot.

Wilderness Companion
A sorcerer or wizard might desire a more durable companion to accompany him on excursions into the wilderness.

This variant simply swaps one or more of a class''s features for one or more class features of another class. A class feature gained works just as it did for its original class, including the level at which it is gained and any other effects, except as noted below.

Lose: Familiar.

Gain: Animal companion (as druid; treat sorcerer or wizard as a druid of half his class level).

Wizard of Sun and Moon
You have attuned yourself to the motions of the cosmos. The sun does more than mark off the day as it travels across the sky. It alters the magic you command and the spells available to you. When in the sun''s warm embrace, you can cast one set of spells. When you journey into the dark, or when the moon hangs in the sky, you gain access to a second set of spells. This alternative class feature does not give you more spells to cast; it gives you more to prepare and choose from.

Level: 1st.

Replaces: If you select this alternative class feature, you do not gain a familiar.

Benefit: You can designate one slot per spell level above 0 as the union of sun and moon. When you prepare your spells, you can prepare two spells for one or more of these slots. Designate one of the two as a spell of the moon and the other as a spell of the sun. You can cast the moon spell only if you are underground or aboveground during the night, and you can cast the sun spell only when you are aboveground during daylight hours. If you cast one of these paired spells, it takes effect normally, but you no longer can use that spell slot to cast the spell from the opposite environment.

For example, Mialee is a 5th-level wizard with Intelligence 16. She selects this class option and prepares her spells for the day as follows. In the list, a superscript M denotes a spell of the moon, which can be cast only underground, or at night aboveground, and a superscript S denotes a spell of the sun, which can be cast only aboveground in daylight.

3rd - DaylightM, displacementS, suggestion;

2nd - Blur, mirror imageM, scorching ray, Tasha''s hideous laughterS;

1st - Animate ropeS, hypnotism, magic missile, magic weaponM, sleep;

0 - Acid splash, daze, read magic, resistance.

If Mialee casts daylight while underground, she marks that spell plus its environmentally opposite spell of the same level (in this case, displacement) off her list of prepared spells.',
