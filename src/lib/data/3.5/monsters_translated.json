It has pearly, opalescent eyes and seems to give off a radiant\n> aura.*\nGhaeles are the knights-errant of the celestials. Wherever evil and tyranny raise their ugly heads, the ghaeles respond. Working behind the scenes\nmore than other eladrins, ghaeles quietly muster resistance and offer guidance to any of good heart with the courage to stand against their\noppressors.\nA ghaele can take the form of an incorporeal globe of eldritch colors, 5 feet in diameter. A ghaele is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 170\npounds.\nGhaeles speak Celestial, Infernal, and Draconic, but can communicate with almost any creature, thanks to their tongues ability.\n##### Combat\nGhaeles who enter combat prefer direct confrontation and damaging attacks to more subtle or insidious methods. They usually fight\nin their humanoid form, wielding incandescent +4 holy greatswords. If a ghaele desires mobility, it assumes its globe form and blasts the enemy with\nlight rays.\nA ghaele’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and good-aligned for the purpose of overcoming\ndamage reduction.\n**Spell-Like Abilities**: Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.\nAt will\n- [aid](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#aid), [charm monster](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#charm-monster) (DC 17), [color spray](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#color-spray) (DC 14), [comprehend languages](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#comprehend-languages), [continual flame](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#continual-flame), [cure light wounds](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#cure-light-wounds) (DC 14), [dancing lights](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dancing-lights), [detect evil](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#detect-evil), [detect thoughts](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#detect-thoughts) (DC 15), [disguise self](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#disguise-self), dispel magic, [hold monster](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#hold-monster) (DC 18), [greater invisibility](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#greater-invisibility) (self only), [major image](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#major-image) (DC 16), [see invisibility](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#see-invisibility), [greater teleport](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#greater-teleport) (self plus 50 pounds of objects only);\n1/day\n- [chain lightning](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#chain-lightning) (DC 19), [prismatic spray](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#prismatic-spray) (DC 20), [wall of force](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#wall-of-force).\n**Spells**: Ghaeles in humanoid form can cast divine spells as 14th-level clerics. A ghaele has access to two of the following domains: Air,\nAnimal, Chaos, Good, or Plant (plus any others from its deity). The save DCs are Wisdom-based.\n*Typical Cleric Spells Prepared (6/7/7/6/5/4/4/3; save DC 13 + spell level)*:\n[0](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#0) - cure minor wounds, detect magic,\nguidance, light, resistance, virtue;\n[1st](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#first) - bless, calm animals\\*, command,\ndivine favor, obscuring mist, sanctuary, shield of faith;\n[2nd](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#second) - aid, align weapon, bear\n’s endurance, hold animal\\*, lesser restoration, remove paralysis, zone of truth;\n[3rd](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#third) - daylight, gaseous form\\*,\nprayer, remove curse, searing light, water breathing;\n[4th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#fourth) - death ward, dismissal, divine\npower, restoration, summon nature’s ally IV (animal)\\*;\n[5th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#fifth) - control winds\\*, flame strike,\nraise dead, true seeing;\n[6th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#sixth) - banishment, blade barrier,\nchain lightning\\*, heal;\n[7th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/clericSpells.html#seventh) - animal shapes\\*, holy word,\nsummon monster VII.\n\\*Domain spell. Domains: Air and Animal.\n**Gaze (Su)**: In humanoid form - slay evil creatures of 5 or less HD, range 60 feet, Will DC 18 negates. Even if the save succeeds, the\ncreature is affected as though by a [fear](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#fear) spell for 2d10 rounds. Nonevil creatures,\nand evil creatures with more than 5 HD, must succeed on a DC 18 Will save or suffer the fear effect. The save DCs are Charisma-based.\n**Light Ray (Ex)**: A ghaele in globe form can project light rays with a range of 300 feet. This attack overcomes [damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR) of any type.\n**Alternate Form (Su)**: A ghaele can shift between its humanoid and globe forms as a standard action. In humanoid form, it cannot fly or use\nits light rays, but it can use its gaze attack and spell-like abilities, make physical attacks, and cast spells. In globe form, it can fly, use its\nlight rays, and use spell-like abilities, but it cannot cast spells or use its gaze attack. The globe form is [incorporeal](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#incorporeal), and the ghaele has no Strength score while in that form.\nA ghaele remains in one form until it chooses to assume a new one. A change in form cannot be dispelled, nor does the ghaele revert to any\nparticular form when killed. A [true seeing](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#true-seeing) spell or ability, however,\nreveals both forms simultaneously.\n**Protective Aura (Su)**: Against attacks made or effects created by evil creatures, this ability provides a +4 deflection bonus to AC and a +4\nresistance bonus on saving throws to anyone within 20 feet of the ghaele. Otherwise, it functions as a [magic circle against evil](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#magic-circle.against-evil) effect and a [lesser globe of\ninvulnerability](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#lesser-globe-of-invulnerability), both with a radius of 20 feet (caster level equals ghaele’s HD). (The defensive benefits from the circle are not included\nin a ghaele’s statistics block.)\n**Tongues (Su)**: Ghaeles can speak with any creature that has a language, as though using a [tongues](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#tongues) spell (caster level 14th). This ability is always active.\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ELEMENTAL |\n|  |\nElementals are incarnations of the elements that compose existence.\n#### COMBAT\nElementals have varied combat abilities and tactics, but all have the same elemental qualities.\n#### AIR ELEMENTAL\n|  | Air Elemental, Small  Small [Elemental](../../monsterTypes.html#elemental) ([Air](../../monsterTypes.html#air), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar)) |  | Air Elemental, Medium  Medium [Elemental](../../monsterTypes.html#elemental) ([Air](../../monsterTypes.html#air), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar)) |  | Air Elemental, Large  Large [Elemental](../../monsterTypes.html#elemental) ([Air](../../monsterTypes.html#air), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar)) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 2d8 (9 hp) |  | 4d8+8 (26 hp) |  | 8d8+24 (60 hp) |\n| **Initiative:** | +7 |  | +9 |  | +11 |\n| **Speed:** | Fly 100 ft.

Darker bits of twirling vapor form\n> the suggestion of two eyes and a mouth, but this could be a trick of the swirling air.*\nAir elementals are among the swiftest and most agile creatures in existence. They seldom leave their home plane except when summoned elsewhere by\na spell.\nAir elementals speak Auran, though they rarely choose to do so. The voice of an air elemental sounds like the high-pitched screech of a tornado or\nthe low moan of a midnight storm\n##### Combat\nTheir rapid speed makes air elementals useful on vast battlefields or in extended aerial combat.\n**Air Mastery (Ex)**: Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against an air elemental.\n**Whirlwind (Su)**: The elemental can transform itself into a whirlwind once every 10 minutes and remain in that form for up to 1 round for\nevery 2 HD it has. In this form, the elemental can move through the air or along a surface at its fly speed.\nThe whirlwind is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and up to 50 feet tall, depending on the elemental’s size. The\nelemental controls the exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.\nThe elemental’s movement while in whirlwind form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another\ncreature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the whirlwind if it touches or enters the whirlwind, or if the elemental moves into or through\nthe creature’s space.\nCreatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the whirlwind (see the table below for details)\nand may be lifted into the air. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the whirlwind or take the\nindicated damage. It must also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful winds, automatically taking\nthe indicated damage each round. A creature that can fly is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the whirlwind. The creature still takes damage\nbut can leave if the save is successful. The DC for saves against the whirlwind’s effects varies with the elemental’s size (see the\ntable). The save DC is Strength based.\nCreatures trapped in the whirlwind cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the\nwhirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must succeed on a [Concentration](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#concentration) check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty\nto Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the whirlwind at one time as will\nfit inside the whirlwind’s volume.\nThe elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. A summoned elemental\nalways ejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.\nIf the whirlwind’s base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a\ndiameter equal to half the whirlwind’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have\nconcealment, while those farther away have total concealment.

The larger ones can pound almost anything into rubble. They seldom leave their home plane except\nwhen summoned elsewhere by a spell.\nWhen summoned to the Material Plane, an earth elemental consists of whatever types of dirt, stones, precious metals, and gems it was conjured\nfrom.\nEarth elementals speak Terran but rarely choose to do so. An earth elemental’s voice sounds like an echo in a deep tunnel, the rumbling of\nan earthquake, or the grinding of plates of stone.\n##### Combat\nThough an earth elemental moves slowly, it is a relentless opponent. It can travel though solid ground or stone as easily as\nhumans walk on the earth’s surface. It cannot swim, however, and must either walk around a body of water or go through the ground under it. An\nearth elemental can move along the bottom of a body of water but prefers not to.\n**Earth Mastery (Ex)**: An earth elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its foe are touching the ground. If an\nopponent is airborne or waterborne, the elemental takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not included in the\nstatistics block.)\n**Push (Ex)**: An earth elemental can start a [bull\nrush](../../../basic/specialAttacks.html#bull-rush) maneuver without provoking an attack of opportunity. The combat modifiers given in Earth Mastery, above, also apply to the elemental’s\nopposed Strength checks.\n**Earth Glide (Ex)**: An earth elemental can glide through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish\nswims through water. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other signs of its presence. A [move earth](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#move-earth) spell cast on an area containing a burrowing earth elemental flings the\nelemental back 30 feet, stunning the creature for 1 round unless it succeeds on a DC 15 Fortitude save.\n**Earth Elemental Sizes**\n| Elemental | Height | Weight |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Small | 4 ft. | 80 lb. |\n| Medium | 8 ft. | 750 lb. |\n| Large | 16 ft. | 6,000 lb. |\n| Huge | 32 ft. | 48,000 lb. |\n| Greater | 36 ft. | 54,000 lb. |\n| Elder | 40 ft. | 60,000 lb. |\n#### FIRE ELEMENTAL\n|  | Fire Elemental, Small  Small [Elemental](../../monsterTypes.html#elemental) ([Fire](../../monsterTypes.html#fire), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar)) |  | Fire Elemental, Medium  Medium [Elemental](../../monsterTypes.html#elemental) ([Fire](../../monsterTypes.html#fire), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar)) |  | Fire Elemental, Large  Large [Elemental](../../monsterTypes.html#elemental) ([Fire](../../monsterTypes.html#fire), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar)) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 2d8 (9 hp) |  | 4d8+8 (26 hp) |  | 8d8+24 (60 hp) |\n| **Initiative:** | +5 |  | +7 |  | +9 |\n| **Speed:** | 50 ft.

The merest touch from their fiery bodies is sufficient to set many materials aflame.\nA fire elemental cannot enter water or any other nonflammable liquid. A body of water is an impassible barrier unless the fire elemental can step\nor jump over it.\nFire elementals speak Ignan, though they rarely choose to do so. When one speaks, its voice sounds like the crackle and hiss of a great fire.\n##### Combat\nA fire elemental is a fierce opponent that attacks its enemies directly and savagely. It takes joy in burning the creatures and\nobjects of the Material Plane to ashes.\n**Burn (Ex)**: A fire elemental’s slam attack deals bludgeoning damage plus fire damage from the elemental’s flaming body. Those\nhit by a fire elemental‘s slam attack also must succeed on a Reflex save or catch on fire. The flame burns for 1d4 rounds. The save DC varies\nwith the elemental’s size (see the table below). A burning creature can take a move action to put out the flame.

The waves cascade and storm around a\n> central, humanoidshaped whirlpool, with watery appendages that pound with the force of an ocean storm.*\nA water elemental can be as ferocious and powerful as a stormy sea.\nA water elemental can’t venture more than 180 feet from the body of water from which it was conjured.\nWater elementals speak Aquan but rarely choose to do so. When one speaks, its voice sounds like the crashing of waves on a rocky shore or the\nhowls of an ocean gale.\n##### Combat\nA water elemental prefers to fight in a large body of water where it can disappear beneath the waves and suddenly swell up behind\nits opponents.\n**Water Mastery (Ex)**: A water elemental gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls if both it and its opponent are touching water. If the\nopponent or the elemental is touching the ground, the elemental takes a –4 penalty on attack and damage rolls. (These modifiers are not\nincluded in the statistics block.)\nA water elemental can be a serious threat to a ship that crosses its path. An elemental can easily overturn small craft (5 feet of length per Hit\nDie of the elemental) and stop larger vessels (10 feet long per HD). Even large ships (20 feet long per HD) can be slowed to half speed.\n**Drench (Ex)**: The elemental’s touch puts out torches, campfires, exposed lanterns, and other open flames of nonmagical origin if these\nare of Large size or smaller. The creature can dispel magical fire it touches as [dispel magic](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dispel-magic) (caster level equals elemental’s HD).\n**Vortex (Su)**: The elemental can transform itself into a whirlpool once every 10 minutes, provided it is underwater, and remain in that form\nfor up to 1 round for every 2 HD it has. In vortex form, the elemental can move through the water or along the bottom at its swim speed. The vortex\nis 5 feet wide at the base, up to 30 feet wide at the top, and 10 feet or more tall, depending on the elemental’s size. The elemental controls\nthe exact height, but it must be at least 10 feet.\nThe elemental’s movement while in vortex form does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the elemental enters the space another\ncreature occupies. Another creature might be caught in the vortex if it touches or enters the vortex, or if the elemental moves into or through the\ncreature’s space.\nCreatures one or more size categories smaller than the elemental might take damage when caught in the vortex (see the table below for details) and\nmay be swept up by it. An affected creature must succeed on a Reflex save when it comes into contact with the vortex or take the indicated damage. It\nmust also succeed on a second Reflex save or be picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents, automatically taking damage each round.\nAn affected creature is allowed a Reflex save each round to escape the vortex. The creature still takes damage, but can leave if the save is\nsuccessful. The DC for saves against the vortex’s effects varies with the elemental’s size. The save DC is Strength-based.\nCreatures trapped in the vortex cannot move except to go where the elemental carries them or to escape the whirlwind. Creatures caught in the\nwhirlwind can otherwise act normally, but must make a [Concentration](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#concentration) check (DC 10 + spell level) to cast a spell. Creatures caught in the whirlwind take a –4 penalty\nto Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls. The elemental can have only as many creatures trapped inside the vortex at one time as will fit\ninside the vortex’s volume.\nThe elemental can eject any carried creatures whenever it wishes, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. A summoned elemental always\nejects trapped creatures before returning to its home plane.\nIf the vortex’s base touches the bottom, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on the elemental and has a diameter\nequal to half the vortex’s height. The cloud obscures all vision, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment,\nwhile those farther away have total concealment. Those caught in the cloud must make a Concentration check (DC 15 + spell level) to cast a spell.\nAn elemental in vortex form cannot make slam attacks and does not threaten the area around it.\n**Skills**: A water elemental has a +8 racial bonus on any [Swim](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#swim) check to perform some special action or avoid a hazard. It can always choose to take 10 on a Swim\ncheck, even if distracted or endangered. It can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line.\n**Water Elemental Sizes**\n|  |  |  | Vortex | | |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Elemental | Height | Weight | Save DC | Damage | Height |\n| Small | 4 ft. | 34 lb. | 13 | 1d4 | 10–20 ft. |\n| Medium | 8 ft. | 280 lb. | 15 | 1d6 | 10–30 ft. |\n| Large | 16 ft. | 2,250 lb. | 19 | 2d6 | 10–40 ft. |\n| Huge | 32 ft. | 18,000 lb. | 25 | 2d8 | 10–50 ft. |\n| Greater | 36 ft. | 21,000 lb. | 28 | 2d8 | 10–60 ft. |\n| Elder | 40 ft. | 24,000 lb. | 31 | 2d8 | 10–60 ft. |\n|  |\n| --- |\n| ELF |\n|  |\n|  | Elf, 1st-Level Warrior  Medium [Humanoid](../../monsterTypes.html#humanoid) (Elf) |  | Drow, 1st-Level Warrior  Medium [Humanoid](../../monsterTypes.html#humanoid) (Elf) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Hit Dice:** | 1d8 (4 hp) |  | 1d8 (4 hp) |\n| **Initiative:** | +1 |  | +1 |\n| **Speed:** | 30 ft.

Pointed ears grace the sides of its elongated\n> head. It wears armor with a natural, forest-themed design that appears organic instead of worked and crafted.*\nElves are aloof guardians of the forests, studying magic and swordplay for the duration of their long lives.\nElves average 5 feet tall and typically weigh just over 100 pounds. They live on fruits and grains, though they occasionally hunt for fresh meat.\nElves prefer colorful clothes, usually with a green-and-gray cloak that blends well with the colors of the forest. They appreciate beautiful things,\nfrom elegant jewelry to attractive flowers to decorated clothing and tools.\nLike dwarves, elves are craftmasters, although they work in wood and metal rather than metal and stone. Elven items are prized by other races, and\nmany elven communities have become prosperous by trading crafted goods with other peoples in and out of the forests.\nElves speak Elven, and most also know Common and Sylvan.\nMost elves encountered outside their homes are warriors; the information presented here is for one of 1st level.\n#### ELF SOCIETY\nElves believe that independence and freedom for the individual are more important than the rigid structures of civilization, so they tend to live\nand travel in small bands. These bands accept the loose authority of a noble, who in turn owes allegiance to an elven monarch (who rules his or her\nown band directly).\nElves live in harmony with nature, building temporary camps that blend into the trees—or are in the branches of the trees, away from prying\neyes. They frequently have animal guardians or giant eagles watching their homes. An elven settlement contains noncombatants (mostly children) equal\nto 20% of the fighting population. Elf society is egalitarian, and males or females may be found in almost any role.\nTheir long life span gives elves a patient perspective and allows them to take pleasure in the enduring beauty of the natural world. They\ndon’t see the point in short-term gains and instead learn things that will provide joy for years to come, such as stories, music, art, and\ndance. Treasures such as elven music and crafts disguise the fact that elves are dedicated warriors determined to check the spread of evil in the\nforests.\nElves eat little, and although they are omnivorous, they eat more plants than meat. This is partly because of their affinity with nature (they\nbelieve a harvested plant causes less disruption to nature than a slain animal) and partly because their fondness for roving requires food that is\npreserved more easily.\nThe chief elf deity is Corellon Larethian, who is the creator and protector of the race.\n#### COMBAT\nElves are cautious warriors and take time to analyze their opponents and the location of the fight if at all possible, maximizing\ntheir advantage by using ambushes, snipers, and camouflage. They prefer to fire from cover and retreat before they are found, repeating this maneuver\nuntil all of their enemies are dead.\nThey prefer longbows, shortbows, rapiers, and longswords. In melee, elves are graceful and deadly, using complex maneuvers that are beautiful to\nobserve. Their wizards often use [sleep](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#sleep) spells during combat because these\nwon’t affect other elves.\n**Elf Traits (Ex)**: Elves possess the following racial traits.\n* +2 Dexterity, –2 Constitution.\n* Medium size.\n* An elf ’s base land speed is 30 feet.\n* Immunity to sleep spells and effects, and a +2 racial saving throw bonus against enchantment spells or effects. (Not reflected in the saving throw\n  modifiers given here.)\n* Low-light vision.\n* Weapon Proficiency: Elves are automatically proficient with the longsword, rapier, longbow, composite longbow, shortbow, and composite\n  shortbow.\n* +2 racial bonus on [Listen](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#listen), [Search](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#search), and [Spot](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#spot) checks. An elf who merely passes within 5 feet of a secret or concealed door is entitled to a Search\n  check to notice it as if she were actively looking for it.\n* Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Draconic, Gnoll, Gnome, Goblin, Orc, Sylvan.\n* Favored Class: [Wizard](../../../classes/baseCore/wizard.html).\nThe elf warrior presented here had the following ability scores before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.\n#### SUBRACES\nThe above information describes the high elf, the most common variety. There are five other major subraces of elf, in addition to\nhalf-elves, who share enough elven characteristics to be included here.\n##### Half-Elf\nHalf-elves are not truly an elf subrace, but they are often mistaken for elves. Half-elves usually inherit a good blend of their\nparents’ physical characteristics.\n**Half-Elf Traits (Ex)**: Half-elves possess the following racial traits.\n* Medium size.\n* A half-elf ’s base land speed is 30 feet.\n* Immunity to sleep spells and similar magical effects, and a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against enchantment spells or effects.\n* Low-light vision.\n* �+1 racial bonus on [Listen](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#listen), [Search](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#search), and [Spot](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#spot) checks. A half-elf does not have the elf ’s ability to notice secret doors simply by passing\n  near them.\n* +2 racial bonus on [Diplomacy](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#diplomacy) and [Gather Information](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#gather-information) checks: Half-elves get along naturally\n  with all people. This bonus may not apply in situations or settings where half-elves are viewed with distrust.\n* Elven Blood: For all effects related to race, a half-elf is considered an elf. Half-elves, for example, are just as vulnerable to special effects\n  that affect elves as their elf ancestors are, and they can use magic items that are only usable by elves.\n* Automatic Languages: Common, Elven. Bonus Languages: Any (other than secret languages, such as Druidic).\n* Favored Class: Any. When determining whether a multiclass half-elf takes an experience point penalty for multiclassing, her highest-level class\n  does not count.\n##### Aquatic Elf\n> *This humanoid is slender and slightly shorter than a human. It has pale, greenish silver skin and emerald green hair. Its ears are\n> pointed, and its fingers and toes are partially webbed.*\nAlso called sea elves, these creatures are waterbreathing cousins to land-dwelling elves. They cavort amid the waves and the ocean depths with\nallies such as dolphins and whales. Aquatic elves fight underwater with tridents, spears, and nets. Many aquatic elves revere Deep Sashelas, an\nundersea god of knowledge and beauty.\n**Aquatic Elf Traits (Ex)**: These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, except where noted.\n* +2 Dexterity, –2 Intelligence. These adjustments replace the high elf ’s ability score adjustments.\n* An aquatic elf has the [aquatic subtype](../../monsterTypes.html#aquatic).\n* An aquatic elf has a swim speed of 40 feet.\n* Gills: Aquatic elves can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution (after that, refer to the suffocation rules).\n* Superior Low-Light Vision: Aquatic elves can see four times as far as a human in starlight, moonlight, torchlight, and similar conditions of low\n  illumination. This trait replaces the high elf ’s low-light vision.\n* Favored Class: [Fighter](../../../classes/baseCore/fighter.html). This trait replaces the high elf\n  ’s favored class.\n##### Drow\n![](../../../resource/images/mm1/MM35_PG103.jpg)\n> *This humanoid is slender and shorter than a human. It has jet black skin and white hair.*\nAlso known as dark elves, drow are a depraved and evil subterranean offshoot.\nWhite is the most common hair color among drow, but almost any pale shade is possible. Drow tend to be smaller and thinner than other sorts of\nelves, and their eyes are often a vivid red. Their society is matriarchal and rigidly controlled by the priesthood.\nThe drow’s patron deity is the spider goddess Lolth. Female drow favor the cleric class rather than wizard and have access to two of the\nfollowing domains: Chaos, Destruction, Evil, or Trickery. Drow usually coat their arrows with a potent venom.\n**Poison (Ex)**: An opponent hit by a drow’s poisoned weapon must succeed on a DC 13 Fortitude save or fall [unconscious](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#unconscious). After 1 minute, the subject must succeed\non another DC 13 Fortitude save or remain unconscious for 2d4 hours. A typical drow carries 1d4–1 doses of drow knockout poison. Drow typically\ncoat arrows and crossbow bolts with this poison, but it can also be applied to a melee weapon. Note that drow have no special ability to apply poison\nwithout risking being poisoned themselves. Since this poison is not a magical effect, drow and other elves are susceptible to it.\n**Drow Traits (Ex)**: These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, except where noted.\n* +2 Intelligence, +2 Charisma.\n* Darkvision out to 120 feet. This trait replaces the high elf ’s low-light vision.\n* [Spell resistance](../../monsterTypes.html#SR) equal to 11 + class levels.\n* +2 racial bonus on Will saves against spells and spell-like abilities.\n* Spell-Like Abilities: Drow can use the following spell-like abilities once per day: [dancing lights](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dancing-lights), [darkness](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#darkness), [faerie fire](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#faerie-fire). Caster level equals the drow’s class levels.\n* Weapon Proficiency: A drow is automatically proficient with the hand crossbow, the rapier, and the short sword. This trait replaces the high\n  elf’s weapon proficiency.\n* Automatic Languages: Common, Elven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages: Abyssal, Aquan, Draconic, Drow Sign Language, Gnome, Goblin.

It is paleskinned and dark-haired, with pointed ears.*\nGray elves are the most noble and regal of all elves. Taller and grander in physical appearance than others of their race, gray elves have a\nreputation for being aloof and arrogant (even by elven standards). They certainly are more reclusive than high elves, living in isolated mountain\ncitadels and allowing entry only to a select few outsiders. They have either silver hair and amber eyes or pale golden hair and violet eyes. They\nprefer clothing of white, silver, yellow, or gold, with cloaks of deep blue or purple.\n**Gray Elf Traits (Ex)**: These traits are in addition to the high elf traits.\n* +2 Intelligence, –2 Strength.\n##### Wild Elf\n> *This humanoid is slender and shorter than a human. Its has dark brown skin, pointed ears, and black hair.*\nWild elves, also known as grugach, are barbaric and tribal. Wild elves’ hair color ranges from black to light brown, lightening to silvery\nwhite with age. They dress in simple clothing of animal skins and basic plant weaves. Though other elves consider them savages, they contend that\nthey are the true elves, for the rest have lost their primal elven essence in needing to build. Nomadic and rugged, wild elves favor the sorcerer\nclass rather than wizard, although many are barbarians as well.\n**Wild Elf Traits (Ex)**: These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, except where noted.\n* +2 Dexterity, –2 Intelligence. These adjustments replace the high elf ’s ability score adjustments.\n* Favored Class: [Sorcerer](../../../classes/baseCore/sorcerer.html). This trait replaces the high elf\n  ’s favored class.\n##### Wood Elf\nAlso called sylvan elves, members of this subrace live deep in primordial forests. Their hair color ranges from yellow to a coppery red, and they\nare more muscular than other elves. Their clothing is in dark shades of green and earth tones to better blend in with their natural surroundings.\nTheir homes are sometimes guarded by giant owls or leopards\n**Wood Elf Traits (Ex)**: These traits are in addition to the high elf traits, except where noted.\n* +2 Strength, –2 Intelligence.\n* Favored Class: [Ranger](../../../classes/baseCore/ranger.html).

Their ability to move quickly between the\nEthereal Plane and the Material Plane makes them spectacular pickpockets.\nEthereal filchers dwell on the Material Plane, where they stuff their lairs with all manner of refuse. They prefer secluded, inaccessible spots,\nsuch as the bottom of an abandoned well or mine shaft, an alpine cave, or the basement of a ruined building.\nEthereal filchers do not speak.\n#### COMBAT\nAn ethereal filcher prowls about, using its [ethereal\njaunt](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#ethereal-jaunt) ability to move about unseen (and often through solid objects). Upon locating a likely mark, it shifts to the Material Plane, attempting to\ncatch its victim unaware. The creature attempts to seize an item, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane.

Their ecology and habits are obscure at best—few have observed them in their natural\nhabitat for any length of time, and their appearances on the Material Plane are limited to those occasions when they are attacking prey. They are\nassumed to have no society or culture in the traditional sense, being motivated solely by the need for sustenance and survival.\nEthereal marauders’ coloration ranges from bright blue to deep violet. An ethereal marauder stands about 4 feet tall, but its overall length\nis about 7 feet. It weighs about 200 pounds.\nEthereal marauders speak no known languages. Survivors of their attacks on the Material Plane claim that they emit an eerie, high whine that\nvaries in pitch depending on the creature’s speed and health.\n#### COMBAT\nOnce a marauder locates prey, it shifts to the Material Plane to attack, attempting to catch its victim flat-footed. The creature\nbites its victim, then retreats quickly back to the Ethereal Plane.

It has a spider’s head with a pair of bulbous black eyes.*\nAlthough not very intelligent, ettercaps are cunning predators. Like the monstrous spiders in whose company they are often found, they are skilled\nhunters and trappers.\nLurking in dark shadows, ettercaps are solitary creatures that exist only to eat and breed. They often make their homes near welltraveled paths or\ngame trails, where food is plentiful. They savor the taste of still-living flesh, often consuming incapacitated prey before it dies.\nEttercaps are very fond of spiders and often keep them as others keep bees. Some ettercaps have a number of monstrous spiders as pets, which are\nas loyal to it as a dog is to a human master. An ettercap is about 6 feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds.\nEttercaps speak Common\n#### COMBAT\nEttercaps are not brave creatures, but their cunning traps often ensure that the enemy never draws a weapon. When an ettercap does\nengage its enemies, it attacks with its keen-edged claws and venomous bite. It usually will not come within melee reach of any foe that is still able\nto move.\n**Poison (Ex)**: Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial damage 1d6 Dex, secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution based and includes a +2\nracial bonus.\n**Web (Ex)**: An ettercap can throw a web eight times per day. This is similar to an attack with a [net](../../../equipment/weapons.html#net) but has a maximum range of 50 feet, with a range increment of 10 feet, and is effective against targets\nof up to Medium size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.\nAn [entangled](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#entangled) creature can escape with a DC 13\n[Escape Artist](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#escape-artist) check or burst the web with a DC 17\nStrength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based, and the Strength check DC includes a +4 racial bonus. The web has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and\ntakes double damage from fire.\nEttercaps can also create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square. They usually position these to snare flying creatures but can also\ntry to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must succeed on a DC 20 [Spot](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#spot) check to notice a web, or they stumble into it and become trapped as though by a successful web\nattack. Attempts to escape or burst the webbing receive a +5 bonus if the trapped creature has something to walk on or grab while pulling free. Each\n5-foot-square section has 6 hit points, hardness 0, and takes double damage from fire.\nAn ettercap can move across its own sheet web at its climb speed and can determine the exact location of any creature touching the web.\n**Skills**: Ettercaps have a +4 racial bonus on [Craft](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#craft)\n(trapmaking), [Hide](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#hide), and [Spot](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#spot) checks.

Each head has a porcine face with a shovel jaw and protruding lower canines like a boar’s\n> tusks. The rest of its teeth are large and rotten. Its stringy hair is filthy, just like the rest of the creature.*\nEttins, or two-headed giants, are vicious and unpredictable hunters that stalk the night. Their two heads make them exceptionally sharp-eyed and\nalert. They are excellent guardians and scouts.\nAn ettin never bathes if it can help it, which usually leaves it so grimy and dirty its skin resembles thick, gray hide (ettins that don’t\nsmell bad are rare indeed). Adult ettins are about 13 feet tall and weigh 5,200 pounds. They live about 75 years.\nEttins have no language of their own but speak a pidgin of Orc, Goblin, and Giant. Creatures that can speak any of these languages must succeed on\na DC 15 Intelligence check to communicate with an ettin. Check once for each bit of information: If the other creature speaks two of these languages,\nthe DC is 10, and for someone who speaks all three, the DC is 5. Ettins talk among themselves without difficulty, despite their low Intelligence, and\na lone ettin often whiles away the hours chatting with itself.\n#### COMBAT\nThough ettins aren’t very intelligent, they are cunning fighters. They prefer to ambush their victims rather than charge\ninto a straight fight, but once the battle has started, an ettin usually fights furiously until all enemies are dead.\n**Superior Two-Weapon Fighting (Ex)**: An ettin fights with a morningstar or javelin in each hand. Because each of its two heads controls an\narm, the ettin does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.\n**Skills**: An ettin’s two heads give it a +2 racial bonus on [Listen](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#listen), [Spot](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#spot), and\n[Search](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#search) checks.\n#### ETTIN SOCIETY\nEttins like to establish their lairs in remote, rocky areas. They dwell in dark, underground caves that stink of decaying food and offal. They\ntolerate other creatures, such as orcs, if these can be useful in some way. Otherwise, ettins tend to be violently isolationist, crushing trespassers\nwithout question.\nEttins are generally solitary, and mated pairs stay together for only a few months after a child is born. Young ettins mature quickly. Within\neight to ten months after birth, they are self-sufficient enough to go off on their own.\nOn rare occasions, a particularly strong ettin may gather a small group, or gang, of ettins. This gang stays together only as long as the leader\nis undefeated. Any major defeat shatters the leader’s hold over the others, and they go their separate ways.\nEttins place little value on wealth but are smart enough to understand its value to others. They collect treasure only because it can buy them the\nservices of goblins or orcs. These lesser creatures sometimes build traps around ettins’ lairs, or help them fight off powerful opponents.\n|  |\n| --- |\n| FIENDISH CREATURE |\n|  |\nFiendish creatures dwell on the lower planes, the realms of evil, although they resemble beings found on the Material Plane. They\nare more fearsome in appearance than their earthly counterparts.\n#### CREATING A FIENDISH CREATURE\n“Fiendish” is an inherited template that can be added to any corporeal aberration\n, animal, dragon, fey, giant, humanoid, magical beast, monstrous humanoid, ooze, plant, or vermin of nongood alignment (referred to hereafter as the\nbase creature).\nA fiendish creature uses all the base creature’s statistics and abilities except as noted here. Do not recalculate the creature’s Hit\nDice, base attack bonus, saves, or skill points if its type changes.\n**Size and Type**: [Animals](../../monsterTypes.html#animal) or [vermin](../../monsterTypes.html#vermin) with this template become [magical beasts](../../monsterTypes.html#magical-beast), but otherwise the creature type is unchanged.

They seek to colonize all that they see and incorporate all living things into their hive as\nworkers.\nExpansionist in the extreme, formians are dedicated to spreading their colonies until they have taken over everything and their order is\nunquestioned. To further this end, they attack all other creatures, usually to put them to work building and expanding cities. Formians maintain\nthese “conscripted” workers as well as those mentally dominated by the power of their taskmasters.\nA formian resembles a cross between an ant and a centaur. All formians are covered in a brownish-red carapace; size and appearance differs for\neach variety.\n#### COMBAT\nFormians are generally aggressive, seeking to subdue all they encounter. If they perceive even the slightest threat to their\nhive-city or to their queen, they attack immediately and fight to the death. Any formian also attacks immediately if ordered to do so by a\nsuperior.\n**Hive Mind (Ex)**: All formians within 50 miles of their queen are in constant communication. If one is aware of a particular danger, they all\nare. If one in a group is not flatfooted, none of them are. No formian in a group is considered flanked unless all of them are.\n#### FORMIAN SOCIETY\nFormians build fabulous hive-cities in which hundreds of the creatures dwell. They are born into their station, with no ability to progress.\nWorkers obey orders given by warriors, myrmarchs, or the queen. Warriors carry out the will of their myrmarch commanders or the queen. Myrmarchs take\norders only from the queen herself, although they have different ranks depending on services rendered. These are not positions of power but of\nprestige. The most prestigious of the myrmarchs guard the queen. Taskmasters are equal in rank to warriors but seldom interact with other\nformians.\n#### WORKER\n> *This creature is about the size of a jackal or bulldog. It looks like an ant, but holds its head and thorax upright. It has humanlike\n> shoulders and arms ending in rudimentary hands with blunt claws.*\nWorkers are the lowest-ranking and most common formians. They exist only to serve, performing all the necessary, lowly tasks that the hive needs\ndone.\nWhile workers cannot speak, they can convey simple concepts (such as danger) by body movements. Through the hive mind, however, they can\ncommunicate just fine—although their intelligence still limits the concepts that they can grasp.\nA worker is about 3 feet long and about 2-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 60 pounds. Its hands are suitable only for manual labor.\n##### Combat\nFormian workers fight only to defend their hive-cities, using their mandibled bite.\nA formian worker’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Cure Serious Wounds (Sp)**: Eight workers together can heal a creature’s wounds as though using the [cure serious wounds](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#cure-serious-wounds) spell (caster level 7th). This is a full-round\naction for all eight workers.\n**Make Whole (Sp)**: Three workers together can repair an object as though using the [make whole](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#make-whole) spell (caster level 7th). This is a full-round action for all three\nworkers.\n#### WARRIOR\n> *This creature is about the size of a pony. It looks like an ant, but holds its head and thorax upright. Its mouth features\n> powerful-looking mandibles. The creature has humanlike shoulders and arms ending in powerful hands with sharp claws. Its abdomen bears a\n> stinger.*\nFormian warriors exist only to fight.\nWarriors rank only slightly above workers. They communicate through the hive mind to convey battle plans and make reports to their commanders.\nThey cannot speak otherwise.\nA warrior is about is about 5 feet long and about 4-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 180 pounds.\n##### Combat\nWarriors are wicked combatants, using claws, bite, and a poisonous sting all at once. Through the hive mind, they attack with\ncoordinated and extremely efficient tactics.\nA formian warrior’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Poison (Ex)**: Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n#### TASKMASTER\n> *This creature is about the size of a pony. It looks like an ant, but holds its head and thorax upright. It does not appear to have a\n> mouth. The creature has humanlike shoulders and arms ending in powerful hands with sharp claws. Its abdomen bears a stinger*\nTaskmasters resemble warriors with no mandibles—no apparent mouth at all, in fact. These formians communicate only telepathically and derive\nsustenance from the mental energies of those they dominate.\nA taskmaster’s duty is to gather and control nonformians for integration into the hive. Put simply, taskmasters enslave other creatures.\nThey do not enjoy controlling others but believe it is the only efficient way to spread the hive to all places, a desirable end for all rational\ncreatures. If a taskmaster can manage to “conscript” a laborer without using its dominate monster ability, it will do so.\nThose few souls who have escaped refer to formian hivecities as “work pits.” While formians are not cruel, they are still\nemotionless—and pitiless.\nA taskmaster is about the same size as a warrior.\n##### Combat\nTaskmasters rely on their dominated slaves to fight for them if at all possible. If necessary, though, they can defend themselves\nwith claws and a poison sting.\nA formian taskmaster’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming\n[damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Dominate Monster (Su)**: A taskmaster can use a [dominate\nmonster](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dominate-monster) ability as the spell from a 10th-level caster (Will DC 17 negates), although the subject may be of any kind and may be up to Large size.\nCreatures that successfully save cannot be affected by the same taskmaster’s dominate monster ability for 24 hours. A single taskmaster can\ndominate up to four subjects at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.\n**Dominated Creature (Ex)**: A taskmaster is never encountered alone. One dominated nonformian creature always accompanies it (choose or\ndetermine randomly any creature of CR 4).\n**Poison (Ex)**: Injury, Fortitude DC 15, initial and secondary damage 1d6 Str. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n#### MYRMARCH\n> *This creature is about the size of a light horse. It looks like an ant, but holds its head and thorax upright. Its mouth features\n> powerful-looking mandibles, and it wears an elaborate bronze helmet. The creature has humanlike shoulders and arms ending in humanlike hands. Its\n> abdomen bears a stinger.*\nMyrmarchs are the elite of formian society. Much more than those beneath them, these creatures are individuals, with goals, desires, and creative\nthought. Very rarely do these thoughts conflict with the wishes of the queen, though—most myrmarchs are still very loyal to her.\nMyrmarchs are commanders in formian armies and leaders in formian communities. They are the hands of the queen, carrying out her direct orders and\nmaking sure everything goes as she desires. Myrmarchs also have a secondary role: stamping out chaos wherever and whenever they can. Those who foment\ndisorder, and particularly creatures that revere or exemplify it (such as slaadi), are the hated foes of myrmarchs.\nA myrmarch is about is about 7 feet long and about 5-1/2 feet high at the front. It weighs about 1,500 pounds. Its claws are capable of fine\nmanipulation, like human hands. Each myrmarch wears a bronze helm to signify its position (the more elaborate the helm, the more prestigious the\nposition).\nMyrmarchs speak Formian and Common.\n##### Combat\nMyrmarchs’ claws are like hands and thus serve no combat purpose. Myrmarchs occasionally employ javelins for ranged attacks,\ncoated with poison from their own stingers.\nThey fight intelligently, aiding those under them (if any such are present) and commanding them through the hive mind. If chaotic creatures are\npresent, however, a myrmarch is singleminded in its quest to destroy them.\nA formian myrmarch’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as lawful-aligned for the purpose of overcoming\n[damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Poison (Ex)**: Injury, Fortitude DC 20, initial and secondary damage 2d6 Dex. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n**Spell-Like Abilities**: Caster level 12th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.\nAt will\n- [charm monster](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#charm-monster) (DC 17), clairaudience/ clairvoyance, [detect\nchaos](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#detect-chaos), [detect thoughts](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#detect-thoughts) (DC 15),\n[magic circle against\nchaos](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#magic-circle-against-chaos), [greater\nteleport](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#greater-teleport);\n1/day\n- dictum (DC 20), [order’s wrath](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#order%E2%80%99s-wrath) (DC 17).\n#### QUEEN\n> *This creature looks like a gigantic, bloated ant. Its legs seem atrophied and nonfunctional.*\nThe formian queen sits at the center of the hive-city, her bloated form never moving from the royal chamber. She is served and guarded by the most\nloyal myrmarchs.\nThe formian queen cannot move. With her telepathic abilities, though, she can send instructions to and get reports from any formian within her\nrange. She is about 10 feet long, perhaps 4 feet high, and weighs about 3,500 pounds.\nThe queen speaks Formian and Common, although she can communicate with any creature telepathically.\n##### Combat\nThe queen does not fight. She has no ability to move. If necessary, a team of workers and myrmarchs (or dominated slaves) haul her\nenormous bulk to where she needs to go. This sort of occurrence is very rare, however, and most of the time the queen remains within her\nwell-defended chambers.\nDespite her utter lack of physical activity, the queen can cast spells and use spell-like abilities to great effect in her own defense as well as\nthe defense of the hive-city.\n**Spells**: The queen casts arcane spells as a 17th-level sorcerer.\n*Typical [Sorcerer Spells](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html) Known\n(6/8/7/7/7/7/6/6/4, base save DC 15 + spell level)*:\n[0](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#zero-level) - acid splash, arcane mark,\ndaze, detect magic, light, mage hand, read magic, resistance, touch of fatigue;\n[1st](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#first-level) - comprehend languages,\nidentify, mage armor, magic missile, shield;\n[2nd](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#second-level) - hypnotic pattern,\ninvisibility, protection from arrows, resist energy, scorching ray;\n[3rd](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#third-level) - dispel magic, heroism,\nnondetection, slow;\n[4th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#fourth-level) - confusion, detect\nscrying, black tentacles, scrying;\n[5th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#fifth-level) - cone of cold, dismissal,\nteleport, wall of force;\n[6th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#sixth-level) - analyze dweomer,\ngeas/quest, repulsion;\n[7th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#seventh-level) - summon monster VII,\nvision, waves of exhaustion;\n[8th](../../../magic/spells/classSpellLists/wizardSpells.html#eighth-level) - prismatic wall,\ntemporal stasis.\n**Spell-Like Abilities**: Caster level 17th.

It surfaces only to\nattack its prey. Frost worms eat yaks, polar bears, walruses, seals, moose, and mammoths.\nSages cannot agree whether this horrible monster is related to the purple worm or to the remorhaz. Perhaps the answer is neither. It is true that\nfrost worms hate remorhazes and attack them on sight in a colossal battle that might very well lay waste to a large area. Remorhazes are frequently\nthe victors in such battles.\nA frost worn cannot burrow through stone, but can manage ice and frozen earth. When moving through such hard materials it leaves behind a usable\ntunnel about 5 feet in diameter.\nFrost worms lay eggs that to the untrained observer appear to be simply oval-shaped ice formations. Hatchling frost worms must immediately fend\nfor themselves, growing to maturity in three to five years. Tribesfolk of the cold wastes can sometimes train young frost worms to help protect the\ncommunity and even to be ridden using magic, cold-resistant saddles.\nA frost worm is about 40 feet long, 5 feet in diameter, and weighs about 8,000 pounds.\n#### COMBAT\nFrost worms lurk under the snow, waiting for prey to come near. They begin an attack with a trill and then set upon helpless prey\nwith their bite.\n**Trill (Su)**: A frost worm can emit a noise that forces its prey to stand motionless. This sonic mind-affecting compulsion affects all\ncreatures other than frost worms within a 100-foot radius. Creatures must succeed on a DC 17 Will save or be [stunned](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned) for as long as the worm trills and for 1d4 rounds thereafter, even if they are\nattacked. However, if attacked or violently shaken (a full-round action), a victim is allowed another saving throw. Once a creature has resisted or\nbroken the effect, it cannot be affected again by that same frost worm’s trill for 24 hours. The effect’s caster level is 14th. The save\nDC is Charisma-based.\n**Cold (Ex)**: A frost worm’s body generates intense cold, causing opponents to take an extra 1d8 points of cold damage every time the\ncreature succeeds on a bite attack. Creatures attacking a frost worm unarmed or with natural weapons take this same cold damage each time one of\ntheir attacks hits.\n**Breath Weapon (Su)**: 30-foot cone, once per hour, damage 15d6 cold, Reflex DC 22 half. Opponents held motionless by the frost worm’s\ntrill get no saving throw.

Incapable of photosynthesis, it exists as a parasite, breaking down organic matter\nslowly. While both of the creatures described here occur individually, shriekers and violet fungi often coexist in the same environment\n#### COMBAT\nShriekers and violet fungi often work together to attract and kill prey. When the shriekers’ hellish racket attracts a\ncurious creature, the violet fungus tries to kill it. Both creatures enjoy the fruits of a successful hunt.\n#### SHRIEKER\n> *This creature looks like a human-sized mushroom.*\nA shrieker is a stationary fungus that emits a loud noise to attract prey or when disturbed. Shriekers live in dark, subterranean\nplaces, often in the company of violet fungi, whose poison they are immune to.\nShriekers come in of shades of purple.\n##### Combat\nA shrieker has no means of attack. Instead, it lures prey to its vicinity by emitting a loud noise.\n**Shriek (Ex)**: Movement or a light source within 10 feet of a shrieker causes the fungus to emit a piercing sound that lasts for 1d3 rounds.\nThe sound attracts nearby creatures that are disposed to investigate it. Some creatures that live near shriekers come to learn that the\nfungus’s noise means there is food nearby.\n#### VIOLET FUNGUS\n> *This human-sized mushroom has four tendrillike tentacles and a mass of small, rootlike feelers at its base that enable it to move\n> slowly.*\nViolet fungi resemble shriekers and are often found growing among them.\nA violet fungi’s coloration ranges from purple overall to dull gray or violet covered with purple spots.\n##### Combat\nA violet fungus flails about with its tentacles at living creatures that come within its reach.\n**Poison (Ex)**: Injury, Fortitude DC 14, initial and secondary damage 1d4 Str and 1d4 Con.

Prefieren disparar desde cobertura y retirarse antes de ser encontrados, repitiendo esta maniobra.\nhasta que todos sus enemigos estén muertos.\nPrefieren arcos largos, arcos cortos, estoques y espadas largas.

|\n![](../../../resource/images/mm1/MM35_PG108.jpg)\nLos formianos provienen del plano de Mechanus. Buscan colonizar todo lo que ven e incorporar todos los seres vivos a su colmena como\ntrabajadores.\nExpansionistas en extremo, los formianos se dedican a expandir sus colonias hasta apoderarse de todo y su orden es\nincuestionable. Para lograr este fin, atacan a todas las demás criaturas, generalmente para ponerlas a trabajar en la construcción y expansión de ciudades. Los formianos mantienen\nestos trabajadores \"reclutados\", así como aquellos mentalmente dominados por el poder de sus capataces.\nUn formiano se parece a un cruce entre una hormiga y un centauro. Todos los formianos unestán cubiertos por un caparazón de color rojo parduzco; El tamaño y la apariencia difieren según\ncada variedad.\n#### COMBATEE\nLos formianos son generalmente agresivos y buscan someter a todo lo que encuentran. Si perciben incluso la más mínima amenaza a sus\nciudad colmena o a su reina, atacan inmediatamente y luchan hasta la muerte. Cualquier formiano también ataca inmediatamente si se lo ordena un\nsuperiores.\n**Mente Colmena (Ex)**: Todos los formianos en un radio de 50 millas de su reina están en comunicación constante. Si uno es consciente de un peligro particular, todos ellos\nson. Si uno en un grupo no es desprevenido, ninguno de ellos lo es. Ningún formiano de un grupo se considera flanqueado a menos que todos lo estén.\n#### SOCIEDAD FORMIANA\nLos formianos construyen fabulosas ciudades colmena en las que habitan cientos de criaturas. Nacen en su posición, sin capacidad de progresar.\nLos trabajadores obedecen las órdenes dadas por los guerreros, los mirmarcas o la reina. Los guerreros llevan a cabo la voluntad de sus comandantes mirmarcas o de la reina. Los Myrmarcas toman\nórdenes sólo de la propia reina, aunque tienen diferentes rangos dependiendo de los servicios prestados. Estas no son posiciones de poder sino de\nprestigio. Los más prestigiosos de los mirmarcas custodian a la reina. Los capataces tienen el mismo rango que los guerreros, pero rara vez interactúan con otros.\nformianos.\n#### TRABAJADOR\n> *Esta criatura es aproximadamente del tamaño de un chacal o un bulldog. Parece una hormiga, pero mantiene la cabeza y el tórax erguidos.

Sólo existen para servir, realizando todas las tareas humildes y necesarias que la colmena necesita.\nhecho.\nSi bien los trabajadores no pueden hablar, pueden transmitir conceptos simples (como peligro) mediante movimientos corporales. A través de la mente colmena, sin embargo, pueden\nse comunican bien, aunque su inteligencia todavía limita los conceptos que pueden captar.\nUn trabajador mide aproximadamente 3 pies de largo y aproximadamente 2-1/2 pies de alto en la parte delantera. Pesa alrededor de 60 libras. Sus manos sólo son aptas para el trabajo manual.\n##### Combate\nLos trabajadores formianos luchan sólo para defender sus ciudades colmena, utilizando su mordida mandibular.\nLas armas naturales de un trabajador formiano, así como cualquier arma que empuñe, se tratan como alineadas con la ley con el fin de superar la [reducción de daños] (../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Curar heridas graves (St)**: Ocho trabajadores juntos pueden curar las heridas de una criatura como si usaran el hechizo [curar heridas graves](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#cure-serious-wounds) (nivel de lanzador 7). Esta es una ronda completa\nacción para los ocho trabajadores.\n**Reparar (St)**: Tres trabajadores juntos pueden reparar un objeto como si usaran el hechizo [reparar](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#make-whole) (nivel de lanzador 7).

Se comunican a través de la mente colmena para transmitir planes de batalla y presentar informes a sus comandantes.\nNo pueden hablar de otra manera.\nUn guerrero mide aproximadamente 5 pies de largo y aproximadamente 4-1/2 pies de alto en el frente. Pesa alrededor de 180 libras.\n##### Combate\nLos guerreros son combatientes malvados que usan garras, mordiscos y un aguijón venenoso al mismo tiempo. A través de la mente colmena, atacan con\ntácticas coordinadas y extremadamente eficientes.\nLas armas naturales de un guerrero formiano, así como cualquier arma que empuñe, se tratan como alineadas legalmente con el fin de superar la [reducción de daño] (../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Veneno (Ex)**: Lesión, Fortaleza CD 14, daño inicial y secundario 1d6 Fuerza.

La criatura tiene hombros y brazos parecidos a los humanos que terminan en manos poderosas con garras afiladas. Su abdomen lleva un aguijón*\nLos capataces se parecen a guerreros sin mandíbulas; de hecho, sin boca aparente. Estos formianos se comunican sólo telepáticamente y derivan\nsustento de las energías mentales de aquellos a quienes dominan.\nEl deber de un capataz es reunir y controlar a los no formales para su integración en la colmena. En pocas palabras, los capataces esclavizan a otras criaturas.\nNo les gusta controlar a los demás, pero creen que es la única manera eficaz de extender la colmena a todos los lugares, un fin deseable para todos los seres racionales.\ncriaturas. Si un capataz puede lograr \"reclutar\" a un trabajador sin usar su habilidad de dominar monstruos, lo hará.\nLas pocas almas que han escapado se refieren a las colmenas formianas como \"pozos de trabajo\". Si bien los formianos no son crueles, aún lo son.\nsin emociones y despiadado.\nUn capataz tiene aproximadamente el mismo tamaño que un guerrero.\n##### Combate\nLos capataces confían en que sus esclavos dominados luchen por ellos, si es posible. Sin embargo, si es necesario, pueden defenderse.\ncon garras y un aguijón venenoso.\nLas armas naturales de un capataz formiano, así como cualquier arma que empuñe, se tratan como alineadas legalmente con el propósito de superar\n[reducción de daños](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Dominar Monstruo (Sb)**: Un capataz puede usar un [dominar\nmonstruo](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dominate-monster) habilidad como el hechizo de un lanzador de nivel 10 (Voluntad CD 17 lo niega), aunque el sujeto puede ser de cualquier tipo y puede tener un tamaño de hasta Grande.\nLas criaturas que salvan con éxito no pueden verse afectadas por la habilidad de dominar monstruos del mismo capataz durante 24 horas. Un solo capataz puede\nDominar hasta cuatro materias a la vez. El DC guardado se basa en el carisma.\n**Criatura dominada (Ex)**: un capataz nunca se encuentra solo. Una criatura no formal dominada siempre la acompaña (elige o\ndeterminar aleatoriamente cualquier criatura de CR 4).\n**Veneno (Ex)**: Lesión, Fortaleza CD 15, daño inicial y secundario 1d6 Fuerza.

Mucho más que quienes están debajo de ellos, estas criaturas son individuos, con metas, deseos y creatividad.\npensamiento. Sin embargo, muy raramente estos pensamientos entran en conflicto con los deseos de la reina; la mayoría de los mirmarcas siguen siendo muy leales a ella.\nLos myrmarcas son comandantes de ejércitos formianos y líderes de comunidades formianas. Son las manos de la reina, ejecutando sus órdenes directas y\nasegurándose de que todo salga como ella desea. Los Myrmarcas también tienen un papel secundario: acabar con el caos donde y cuando puedan. Los que fomentan\nEl desorden, y particularmente las criaturas que lo reverencian o ejemplifican (como los slaadi), son los odiados enemigos de los mirmarcas.\nUn mirmarca mide aproximadamente 7 pies de largo y aproximadamente 5-1/2 pies de alto en la parte delantera. Pesa alrededor de 1.500 libras. Sus garras son capaces de hacer finos\nmanipulación, como manos humanas. Cada mirmarca lleva un yelmo de bronce para indicar su posición (cuanto más elaborado sea el yelmo, más prestigioso será el\nposición).\nLos Myrmarcas hablan formiano y común.\n##### Combate\nLas garras de los Myrmarcas son como manos y, por lo tanto, no sirven para ningún propósito de combate. Los Myrmarcas ocasionalmente emplean jabalinas para ataques a distancia,\nrecubiertos con veneno de sus propios aguijones.\nLuchan inteligentemente, ayudando a sus subordinados (si hay alguno presente) y dirigiéndolos a través de la mente colmena.

Mide unos 10 pies de largo, quizás 4 pies de alto y pesa alrededor de 3500 libras.\nLa reina habla formiano y común, aunque puede comunicarse telepáticamente con cualquier criatura.\n##### Combate\nLa reina no pelea.

Lurid flames dance over its skin. In one of its massive\n> clawed hands, this creature bears a sword that looks sharp enough to cut even to the soul. In its other hand, it bears a whip licked by tongues of\n> fire.*\nBalors stand among the greatest and most terrible of the underworld creatures. They rule as generals over demonic armies. They are the masterminds\nof schemes to seize power and destroy the innocent. Even among their own kind, balors are feared, as they motivate their kindred to spread terror and\nmisery.\nA balor stands about 12 feet tall. Its skin is usually dark red. It weighs about 4,500 pounds.\n##### Combat\nBalors love to join battle armed with their swords and whips. If they face stiff resistance, they may [teleport](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#greater-teleport) away to loose a few spell-like\neffects at the foe.\nA balor’s +1 flaming whip is a long, flexible weapon with many tails tipped with hooks, spikes, and balls. The weapon deals bludgeoning and\nslashing damage, in addition to fire damage.\nA balor’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming\n[damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Death Throes (Ex)**: When killed, a balor explodes in a blinding flash of light that deals 100 points of damage to anything within 100 feet\n(Reflex DC 30 half ). This explosion automatically destroys any weapons the balor is holding. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n**Entangle (Ex)**: A balor’s +1 flaming whip [entangles](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#entangled) foes much like an attack with a [net](../../../equipment/weapons.html#net). The whip has 20 hit points. The whip needs no folding. If it hits, the target and the balor immediately make\nopposed Strength checks; if the balor wins, it drags the target against its flaming body (see below). The target remains anchored against the\nbalor’s body until it escapes the whip.\n**Spell-Like Abilities**: Caster level 20th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.\nAt will\n- [blasphemy](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#blasphemy) (DC 25), [dominate monster](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dominate-monster) (DC 27), [greater dispel magic](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#greater-displel-magic), greater teleport (self plus 50 pounds of objects only), [insanity](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#insanity) (DC 25), [power word stun](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#power-word-stun), [telekinesis](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#telekinesis) (DC 23), unholy aura (DC\n26);\n1/day\n- [fire storm](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#fire-storm) (DC 26), [implosion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#implosion) (DC 27).\n**Vorpal Sword (Su)**: Every balor carries a +1 vorpal longsword that looks like a flame or a bolt of lightning.\n**Summon Tanar’ri (Sp)**: Once per day a balor can automatically summon 4d10 [dretches](#dretch-demon), 1d4 [hezrous](#hezrou-demon), or one [nalfeshnee](#nalfeshnee-demon), [glabrezu](#glabrezu-demon),\n[marilith](#marilith-demon), or balor. This ability is the equivalent of a 9th-level spell.\n**Flaming Body (Su)**: The body of a balor is wreathed in flame. Anyone [grappling](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#grappling) a balor takes 6d6 points of fire damage each round.\n**True Seeing (Su)**: Balors have a continuous [true seeing](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#true-seeing) ability,\nas the spell (caster level 20th).\n**Skills**: Balors have a +8 racial bonus on [Listen](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#listen) and\n[Spot](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#spot) checks.\n##### Tactics Round-by-Round\nThe balor is most effective as a ranged combatant, using its spell-like abilities to attack from a distance.\n*Prior to combat*: [Unholy aura](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Unholy-aura).\n*Round 1*: [Fire storm](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Fire-storm) or [implosion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#implosion) and quickened telekinesis, or\nsummon additional demons. If the balor does not deem itself seriously threatened, it conserves abilities usable only once per day and uses [blasphemy](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#blasphemy) instead.\n*Round 2*: [Insanity](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Insanity) or [power word stun](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#power-word-stun).\n*Round 3*: Full melee attack with weapons, including entangle with whip.\n*Round 4*: [Teleport](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Teleport) or fly away with entangled foe to reestablish\nrange; repeat round 1 and continue.\nA balor who wants to drive off or neutralize a party without slaying its foes avoids lethal attacks.\n*Prior to combat*: [Unholy aura](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Unholy-aura).\n*Round 1*: [Dominate monster](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Dominate-monster).\n*Round 2*: [Power word stun](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Power-word-stun).\n*Round 3*: [Insanity](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Insanity) or [telekinesis](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#telekinesis) to incapacitate or repel a dangerous opponent.\n*Round 4*: [Teleport](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#Teleport) or fly away to reestablish range; repeat round 1\nand continue.\n#### BEBILITH\nHuge [Outsider](../../monsterTypes.html#outsider) ([Chaotic](../../monsterTypes.html#chaotic), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar), [Evil](../../monsterTypes.html#evil), [Tanar'ri](../../monsterTypes.html#tanarri))\n**Hit Dice**: 12d8+96 (150 hp)\n**Initiative**: +5\n**Speed**: 40 ft.

Its forelegs end in wicked barbs, and globs of foul goo drip from its fanged\n> mouth.*\nBebiliths are enormous, predatory, arachnid demons that hunt other demons. While they favor preying upon other demons, they aren’t\npicky—they will stalk and attack any type of creature.\nA bebilith has a body the size of a plow horse, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs more than two tons.\nBebiliths understand but do not speak Abyssal. Their telepathy allows them to communicate silently with one another.\n#### COMBAT\nA bebilith attacks any creature it sees. It usually picks one target and concentrates its attacks on that opponent, using its webs\nto isolate the target from its comrades. Should the bebilith become overwhelmed by tougher opponents, it often attempts to bite one or more of its\nvictims and retreats, allowing its [poison](../../monsterTypes.html#poison) to do its work.\nA bebilith’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of\novercoming [damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Poison (Ex)**: Injury, Fortitude DC 24, initial damage 1d6 Con, secondary damage 2d6 Con. Bebilith venom is highly perishable, losing its\npotency and becoming inert, foul-smelling goo almost as soon as it comes into contact with air. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n**Rend Armor (Ex)**: If a bebilith hits with both claw attacks, it pulls apart any armor worn by its foe. This attack deals 4d6+18 points of\ndamage to the opponent’s armor. Creatures not wearing armor are unaffected by this special attack. Armor reduced to 0 hit points is destroyed.\nDamaged armor may be repaired with a successful [Craft](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#craft)\n(armorsmithing) check.\n**Web (Ex)**: A bebilith can throw a web up to four times per day. This is similar to an attack with a [net](../../../equipment/weapons.html#net) but has a maximum range of 30 feet, with a range increment of 10\nfeet. This attack is effective against targets of up to Gargantuan size. The web anchors the target in place, allowing no movement.\nAn [entangled](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#entangled) creature can escape with a DC 24\n[Escape Artist](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#escape-artist) check or burst the web with a DC 24\nStrength check. The check DCs are Constitution-based. The web has 14 hit points and hardness 0. There is a 75% chance that the webbing will not burn\nif any sort of fire is applied to it (check each round).\n**Plane Shift (Su)**: This ability affects only the bebilith. It is otherwise similar to [the spell](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#the-spell) (caster level 12th).\n**Skills**: A bebilith has mottled coloration that gives it a +8 racial bonus on [Hide](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#hide) checks.\n#### DRETCH\nSmall [Outsider](../../monsterTypes.html#outsider) ([Chaotic](../../monsterTypes.html#chaotic), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar), [Evil](../../monsterTypes.html#evil), [Tanar'ri](../../monsterTypes.html#tanarri))\n**Hit Dice**: 2d8+4 (13 hp)\n**Initiative**: +0\n**Speed**: 20 ft.

In one-on-one combat, they rely on their damage reduction to keep\nthem alive. In groups, they depend on sheer numbers to overcome foes and immediately summon other dretches to improve the odds in battle.

Its forelegs end in massive cleavers. Four bulbous\n> eyes, a malevolent gleam in each one, rise out of its carapace.*\nA retriever specializes in recovering lost or desired objects, runaway slaves, and enemies and bringing them back to its master. Retrievers were\ncreated through foul sorcery to be warriors and servants to powerful demon nobles. Most scholars believe retrievers are built to resemble bebiliths.\nMore powerful demons often use these mindless constructs to perform ugly tasks, or tasks they could not trust to their own scheming kind.\nA retriever has a body the size of an ox, with legs spanning more than 14 feet. It weighs about 6,500 pounds.\n##### Combat\nRetrievers attack with four claws, but their eye rays are far more deadly.\n**Eye Rays (Su)**: A retriever’s eyes can produce four different magical rays with a range of 100 feet. Each round, it can fire one ray\nas a free action. A particular ray is usable only once every 4 rounds. A retriever can fire an eye ray in the same round that it makes physical\nattacks. The save DC for all rays is 18. The save DC is Dexterity-based.\nThe four eye effects are:\n*Fire*: Deals 12d6 points of fire damage to the target (Reflex half ).\n*Cold*: Deals 12d6 points of cold damage to the target (Reflex half ).\n*Electricity*: Deals 12d6 points of electricity damage to the target (Reflex half ).\n*Petrification*: The target must succeed on a Fortitude save or [turn to stone](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#petrified) permanently.\n**Find Target (Sp)**: When ordered to find an item or a creature, a retriever does so unerringly, as though guided by [discern location](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#discern-location). The being giving the order\nmust have seen (or must have an item belonging to) the creature to be found, or must have touched the object to be located. This ability is the\nequivalent of an 8th-level spell.\n**Improved Grab (Ex)**: To use this ability, a retriever must hit with its bite attack. It can then attempt to start a [grapple](../../../basic/specialAttacks.html#grapple) as a free action without provoking an attack of\nopportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and grips the opponent fast in its mouth.

They flee combat whenever they can. If forced to fight, they can attack with their claws, but they\nprefer to turn foes against one another. Succubi use their change shape ability to assume humanoid guise, and can maintain this deception\nindefinitely. Their preferred tactic when dealing with heroes is to feign friendship and create an opportunity to be alone with one of them,\nwhereupon the succubus applies her life-draining kiss. Succubi are not above taking on the role of a damsel in distress when encountered within a\ndungeon.\nA succubus’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of\novercoming [damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Change Shape (Su):** A succubus can assume the form of any Small or Medium humanoid.\n**Energy Drain (Su)**: A succubus drains energy from a mortal it lures into some act of passion, or by simply planting a kiss on the victim. If\nthe target is not willing to be kissed, the succubus must start a [grapple](../../../basic/specialAttacks.html#grapple), which provokes an attack of opportunity. The succubus’s kiss or embrace bestows one [negative level](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#energy-drain). The kiss also has the effect of a\n[suggestion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#suggestion) spell, asking the victim to\naccept another kiss from the succubus. The victim must succeed on a DC 21 Will save to negate the effect of the suggestion. The DC is 21 for the\nFortitude save to remove a negative level.

They prance about in battle,\ntaking briefly to the air and bringing their clawed feet into play. Despite their advantage in mobility, the vrocks’ deep love of battle\nfrequently leads them into melee combats against heavy odds.\nA vrock’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of overcoming\n[damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Dance of Ruin (Su)**: To use this ability, a group of at least three vrocks must join hands in a circle, dancing wildly and chanting. At the\nend of 3 rounds of dancing, a wave of crackling energy flashes outward in a 100-foot radius. All creatures except for demons within the radius take\n20d6 points of damage (Reflex DC 18 half ). [Stunning](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned), [paralyzing](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#palalyzed), or slaying one of the vrocks stops the dance.

The spores automatically deal 1d8\npoints of damage to all creatures adjacent to the vrock. They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage each round\nfor 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. (The vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days.) A\n[delay poison](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#delay-poison) spell stops the spores’ growth for its duration.\nBless, [neutralize poison](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#neutralize-poison),\nor remove disease kills the spores, as does sprinkling the victim with a vial of holy water.\n**Stunning Screech (Su)**: Once per hour a vrock can emit a piercing screech. All creatures except for demons within a 30-foot radius must\nsucceed on a DC 22 Fortitude save or be [stunned](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#stunned)\nfor 1 round.

Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with\ncreatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of\nhis mind.\n#### COMBAT\nDerro are stealthy and bloodthirsty. They like to carefully arrange cruel traps and deadly ambushes, and strike savagely from\nhiding. They delight in taking captives who can be tortured to death later, and favor traps and poisons that disable without killing.\n**Madness (Ex)**: Derro use their Charisma modifier on Will saves instead of their Wisdom modifier, and have immunity to [confusion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#confusion) and insanity effects.

It is blind, yet hunts with\na sense of hearing more precise than most creatures’ sight.\nFrom its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a stone wall. So skilled\nis a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can choose what type of material to affect with its attack.\nDestrachans feed on death and misery. They haunt inhabited underground complexes, spreading woe for evil’s own sake. They can blast their\nway through stone well enough to travel beneath the surface as they wish. Sometimes a destrachan subdues its victims and brings them back to its lair\nfor torture and imprisonment. No living thing would ever willingly ally itself with this monster, although sometimes undead or evil outsiders\naccompany a destrachan as it attacks and slays other creatures.\nA destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of the tail and weighs about 4,000 pounds.\nA destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If a destrachan must communicate, it does so through action.\n#### COMBAT\nA destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with\nsurprise if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.\n**Destructive Harmonics (Su)**: A destrachan can blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect any\ncreatures or objects within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the harmonics of this destructive power to affect different types of targets. All save DCs\nare Charisma-based.\n*Flesh*: Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this attack deals 4d6 points of damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).\n*Nerves*: A destrachan can focus its harmonics to knock out foes rather than slay them.

Devils enjoy\nbullying those weaker than themselves and often attack good creatures just to gain a trophy or three. The most powerful devils occupy themselves with\nplots to seize power, wreck civilizations, and inflict misery upon mortals.\nMany devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like\nabilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies\ncan never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.\nThe most numerous devils are the baatezu, infamous for their strength, evil temperament, and ruthlessly efficient organization. Baatezu have a\nrigid caste system, in which authority derives not only from power but also from station. They occupy themselves mainly with extending their\ninfluence throughout the planes by corrupting mortals. Baatezu who further this goal are usually rewarded with improved stations.\n**Baatezu Traits**: Most baatezu possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).\n* Immunity to fire and poison.\n* [Resistance to acid](../../monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy) 10 and cold 10.\n* *See in Darkness (Su)*: All batezu can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a [deeper darkness](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#deeper-darkness) spell.\n* *Summon (Sp)*: Baatezu share the ability to summon others of their kind (the success chance and type of baatezu summoned are noted in each\n  monster description).\n* [Telepathy](../../monsterTypes.html#telepathy).\nExcept when otherwise noted, devils speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.\n#### BARBED DEVIL (HAMATULA)\nMedium [Outsider](../../monsterTypes.html#outsider) ([Baatezu](../../monsterTypes.html#baatezu), [Evil](../../monsterTypes.html#evil), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar), [Lawful](../../monsterTypes.html#lawful))\n**Hit Dice**: 12d8+72 (126 hp)\n**Initiative**: +6\n**Speed**: 30 ft.

Every bearded devil carries a sawtoothed glaive.\nA bearded devil stands 6 feet tall and weighs about 225 pounds.\n##### Combat\nBearded devils are aggressive and love to fight.

An injured creature loses 2 additional hit\npoints each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 [Heal](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#heal) check, a cure spell, or a heal spell. However, a character attempting to cast a cure spell or a heal spell on a creature damaged by a bearded\ndevil’s glaive must succeed on a DC 16 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful Heal check\nautomatically stops the continuing hit point loss as well as restoring hit points. The infernal wound is a supernatural ability of the bearded devil,\nnot of the weapon. The check DC is Constitution-based.\n**Beard (Ex)**: If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it automatically hits with its beard. The affected creature\ntakes 1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be infected with a vile [disease](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#disease) known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days,\ndamage 1d4 Str). Damage is dealt each day until the afflicted creature succeeds on three consecutive Fortitude saves, the disease is cured magically,\nor the creature dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n**Battle Frenzy (Ex)**: Twice per day, a bearded devil can work itself into a battle frenzy similar to the barbarian’s rage (+4 Strength,\n+4 Constitution, +2 morale bonus on Will saves, –2 AC penalty). The frenzy lasts for 6 rounds, and the bearded devil suffers no ill effects\nafterward.\n**Summon Baatezu (Sp)**: Once per day a bearded devil can attempt to summon 2d10 [lemures](#lemure-devil) with a 50% chance of success, or another bearded devil with a 35% chance of success.

The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save\nto remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.\n**Trap Essence (Su)**: The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy’s life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee\nattacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based.\nA slain creature’s essence is trapped within the devourer’s ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim’s features. The\ntrapped essence cannot be [raised](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#raised) or [resurrected](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#resurrection), but a [limited wish](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#limited-wish), miracle, or [wish](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#wish) spell frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A\ndevourer can hold only one essence at a time.\nThe trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped creature. As\nthis energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one [negative level](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#energy-drain) for every five times the devourer uses\none of its spell-like abilities. When the essence’s number of negative levels equals the creature’s total Hit Dice or level, the essence\nis destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose that level\npermanently.\n**Spell-Like Abilities**: At the start of any encounter, the trapped essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels (enough fuel for\nthirty to seventy-five uses). Once per round, a devourer can use one of the following abilities: [confusion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#confusion) (DC 17), [control undead](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#control-undead) (DC 20), [ghoul touch](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#ghoul-touch) (DC 15), [lesser planar ally](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#lesser-planar-ally), ray of enfeeblement (DC 14), [spectral\nhand](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#spectral-hand), suggestion (DC 16), [true\nseeing](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#true-seeing). Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.\n**Spell Deflection (Su)**: The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the\ndevourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence instead: [banishment](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#banishment), [chaos hammer](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#chaos-hammer), [confusion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#confusion), [crushing despair](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#crushing-despair), detect thoughts,\n[dispel evil](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dispel-evil), [dominate person](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dominate-person), fear, [geas/quest](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#geas-quest), [holy word](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#holy-word), [hypnosis](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#hypnosis), [imprisonment](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#imprisonment), magic jar, [maze](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#maze), [suggestion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#suggestion), trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. In many\ncases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its\nspell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.",

Retrievers were\ncreated through foul sorcery to be warriors and servants to powerful demon nobles.

It weighs about 6,500 pounds.\n##### Combat\nRetrievers attack with four claws, but their eye rays are far more deadly.\n**Eye Rays (Su)**: A retriever’s eyes can produce four different magical rays with a range of 100 feet.

They then penetrate the skin and grow, dealing an additional 1d4 points of damage each round\nfor 10 rounds. At the end of this time, the victim is covered with a tangle of viny growths. (The vines are harmless and wither away in 1d4 days.)

Derro are capable of holding their murderous impulses in check for short periods of time in order to cooperate with\ncreatures of other races, but such arrangements rarely last more than a few weeks. Of course, no derro is capable of recognizing that he is out of\nhis mind.\n#### COMBAT\nDerro are stealthy and bloodthirsty.

It is blind, yet hunts with\na sense of hearing more precise than most creatures’ sight.\nFrom its tubular mouth a destrachan emits carefully focused harmonics, producing sonic energy so powerful it can shatter a stone wall. So skilled\nis a destrachan at controlling the sounds it emits that it can choose what type of material to affect with its attack.\nDestrachans feed on death and misery. They haunt inhabited underground complexes, spreading woe for evil’s own sake. They can blast their\nway through stone well enough to travel beneath the surface as they wish. Sometimes a destrachan subdues its victims and brings them back to its lair\nfor torture and imprisonment. No living thing would ever willingly ally itself with this monster, although sometimes undead or evil outsiders\naccompany a destrachan as it attacks and slays other creatures.\nA destrachan is about 10 feet long from its mouth to the tip of the tail and weighs about 4,000 pounds.\nA destrachan speaks no language but understands Common. If a destrachan must communicate, it does so through action.\n#### COMBAT\nA destrachan uses its claws only as a last resort or to finish off foes weakened by its sonic attacks. It often enters battle with\nsurprise if possible. It first focuses on destroying metal armor and weapons and then changes to harmonics that disrupt flesh.\n**Destructive Harmonics (Su)**: A destrachan can blast sonic energy in a cone up to 80 feet long. It can also use this attack to affect any\ncreatures or objects within a 30-foot radius. It can tune the harmonics of this destructive power to affect different types of targets. All save DCs\nare Charisma-based.\n*Flesh*: Disrupting tissue and rending bone, this attack deals 4d6 points of damage to all within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).\n*Nerves*: A destrachan can focus its harmonics to knock out foes rather than slay them. This attack deals 6d6 points of nonlethal damage to\nall within the area (Reflex DC 15 half ).\n*Material*: When using this form of harmonics, a destrachan chooses wood, stone, metal, or glass. All objects made of that material within\nthe area must succeed on a DC 15 Fortitude save or shatter. Objects (or portions of objects) that have up to 30 hit points are potentially affected\nby this attack.\n**Blindsight (Ex)**: A destrachan can use hearing to ascertain all foes within 100 feet as a sighted creature would.\n**Immunities**: Destrachans have immunity to [gaze](../../monsterTypes.html#gaze) attacks, visual\neffects, illusions, and other attack forms that rely on sight.\n**Protection from Sonics (Ex)**: While they can be affected by loud noises and sonic spells (such as ghost\nsound or [silence](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#silence)), destrachans are less vulnerable to sonic attacks (+4\ncircumstance bonus on all saves) because they can protect their ears. A destrachan whose sense of hearing is impaired is effectively [blinded](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#blinded), and all targets are treated as having total\nconcealment.\n**Skills**: A destrachan has a +10 racial bonus on [Listen](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#listen)\nchecks.\n|  |\n| --- |\n| DEVIL |\n|  |\nThe scourge of humanity and the cosmos, devils are fiends from the Nine Hells of Baator, a lawful evil realm. Devils enjoy\nbullying those weaker than themselves and often attack good creatures just to gain a trophy or three. The most powerful devils occupy themselves with\nplots to seize power, wreck civilizations, and inflict misery upon mortals.\nMany devils are surrounded by a fear aura, which they use to break up powerful groups and defeat opponents piecemeal. Devils with spell-like\nabilities use their illusion abilities to delude and confuse foes as much as possible. A favorite trick is to create illusory reinforcements; enemies\ncan never be entirely sure if a threat is only a figment or real summoned devils joining the fray.\nThe most numerous devils are the baatezu, infamous for their strength, evil temperament, and ruthlessly efficient organization. Baatezu have a\nrigid caste system, in which authority derives not only from power but also from station. They occupy themselves mainly with extending their\ninfluence throughout the planes by corrupting mortals. Baatezu who further this goal are usually rewarded with improved stations.\n**Baatezu Traits**: Most baatezu possesses the following traits (unless otherwise noted in a creature’s entry).\n* Immunity to fire and poison.\n* [Resistance to acid](../../monsterTypes.html#resistance-to-energy) 10 and cold 10.\n* *See in Darkness (Su)*: All batezu can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, even that created by a [deeper darkness](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#deeper-darkness) spell.\n* *Summon (Sp)*: Baatezu share the ability to summon others of their kind (the success chance and type of baatezu summoned are noted in each\n  monster description).\n* [Telepathy](../../monsterTypes.html#telepathy).\nExcept when otherwise noted, devils speak Infernal, Celestial, and Draconic.\n#### BARBED DEVIL (HAMATULA)\nMedium [Outsider](../../monsterTypes.html#outsider) ([Baatezu](../../monsterTypes.html#baatezu), [Evil](../../monsterTypes.html#evil), [Extraplanar](../../monsterTypes.html#extraplanar), [Lawful](../../monsterTypes.html#lawful))\n**Hit Dice**: 12d8+72 (126 hp)\n**Initiative**: +6\n**Speed**: 30 ft.

They use hold\nperson to immobilize those who avoid their hug attacks.\nA barbed devil’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are treated as evil-aligned and lawful-aligned for the purpose of\novercoming [damage reduction](../../monsterTypes.html#DR).\n**Fear (Su)**: A creature hit by a barbed devil must succeed on a DC 20 Will save or be affected as though by fear (caster level 9th). Whether or not the save is successful, that creature cannot be affected by that same barbed\ndevil’s fear ability for 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.\n**Impale (Ex)**: A barbed devil deals 3d8+9 points of piercing damage to a grabbed opponent with a successful [grapple](../../../basic/specialAttacks.html#grapple) check.\n**Improved Grab (Ex)**: To use this ability, a barbed devil must hit with a claw attack. It can then attempt to start a [grapple](../../../basic/specialAttacks.html#grapple) as a free action without provoking an attack of\nopportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and can impale the opponent on its barbed body.\n**Summon Baatezu (Sp)**: Once per day a barbed devil can attempt to summon 1d6 [bearded devils](#bearded-devil) or another barbed devil with a 35% chance of success. This ability is the equivalent of a 4th-level\nspell.\n**Barbed Defense (Su)**: Any creature striking a barbed devil with handheld weapons or natural weapons takes 1d8+6 points of piercing and\nslashing damage from the devil’s barbs.

An injured creature loses 2 additional hit\npoints each round. The wound does not heal naturally and resists healing spells. The continuing hit point loss can be stopped by a DC 16 [Heal](../../../skills/skillsAll.html#heal) check, a cure spell, or a heal spell. However, a character attempting to cast a cure spell or a heal spell on a creature damaged by a bearded\ndevil’s glaive must succeed on a DC 16 caster level check, or the spell has no effect on the injured character. A successful Heal check\nautomatically stops the continuing hit point loss as well as restoring hit points. The infernal wound is a supernatural ability of the bearded devil,\nnot of the weapon. The check DC is Constitution-based.\n**Beard (Ex)**: If a bearded devil hits a single opponent with both claw attacks, it automatically hits with its beard. The affected creature\ntakes 1d8+2 points of damage and must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or be infected with a vile [disease](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#disease) known as devil chills (incubation period 1d4 days,\ndamage 1d4 Str). Damage is dealt each day until the afflicted creature succeeds on three consecutive Fortitude saves, the disease is cured magically,\nor the creature dies. The save DC is Constitution-based.\n**Battle Frenzy (Ex)**: Twice per day, a bearded devil can work itself into a battle frenzy similar to the barbarian’s rage (+4 Strength,\n+4 Constitution, +2 morale bonus on Will saves, –2 AC penalty). The frenzy lasts for 6 rounds, and the bearded devil suffers no ill effects\nafterward.\n**Summon Baatezu (Sp)**: Once per day a bearded devil can attempt to summon 2d10 [lemures](#lemure-devil) with a 50% chance of success, or another bearded devil with a 35% chance of success.

The DC is 19 for the Fortitude save\nto remove a negative level. The save DC is Charisma-based.\n**Trap Essence (Su)**: The devourer is named for its ability to consume an enemy’s life essence. To do so, it must forgo its normal melee\nattacks and make a trap essence attack. This requires a normal attack roll but deals no damage. The he save DC is Charisma-based.\nA slain creature’s essence is trapped within the devourer’s ribs, and the tiny figure takes on that victim’s features. The\ntrapped essence cannot be [raised](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#raised) or [resurrected](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#resurrection), but a [limited wish](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#limited-wish), miracle, or [wish](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#wish) spell frees it, as does destroying the devourer. A\ndevourer can hold only one essence at a time.\nThe trapped essence provides a devourer with enough power to use five spell-like abilities for each Hit Die or level of the trapped creature. As\nthis energy is expended, the twisted soul fades away until it evaporates completely. The trapped essence gains one [negative level](../../../basic/abilitiesAndConditions.html#energy-drain) for every five times the devourer uses\none of its spell-like abilities. When the essence’s number of negative levels equals the creature’s total Hit Dice or level, the essence\nis destroyed. If an essence is freed, the restored creature must succeed on a DC 19 Fortitude save for each negative level or lose that level\npermanently.\n**Spell-Like Abilities**: At the start of any encounter, the trapped essence within a devourer is assumed to have 3d4+3 levels (enough fuel for\nthirty to seventy-five uses). Once per round, a devourer can use one of the following abilities: [confusion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#confusion) (DC 17), [control undead](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#control-undead) (DC 20), [ghoul touch](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#ghoul-touch) (DC 15), [lesser planar ally](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#lesser-planar-ally), ray of enfeeblement (DC 14), [spectral\nhand](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#spectral-hand), suggestion (DC 16), [true\nseeing](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#true-seeing). Caster level 18th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.\n**Spell Deflection (Su)**: The trapped essence provides a measure of magical protection. If any of the following spells are cast at the\ndevourer and overcome its spell resistance, they affect the imprisoned essence instead: [banishment](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#banishment), [chaos hammer](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#chaos-hammer), [confusion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#confusion), [crushing despair](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#crushing-despair), detect thoughts,\n[dispel evil](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dispel-evil), [dominate person](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#dominate-person), fear, [geas/quest](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#geas-quest), [holy word](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#holy-word), [hypnosis](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#hypnosis), [imprisonment](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#imprisonment), magic jar, [maze](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#maze), [suggestion](../../../magic/spells/spells/spellsAllCore.html#suggestion), trap the soul, or any form of charm or compulsion. In many\ncases, this deflection effectively neutralizes the spell. Some of these effects might eliminate the trapped essence, depriving the devourer of its\nspell-like abilities until it can consume another victim.",
